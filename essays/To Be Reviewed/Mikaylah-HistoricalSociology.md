## Historical Sociology
Historical Sociology is a discipline `is it it's own discipline?` that focuses on change in societies and allows `(?)` the scholar to understand the historical reasoning behind societal change. History and sociology are two disciplines that many do not see as being compatible, when in fact can be very useful `when used together`. ~~The thought of scholarly disciplines being mixed often makes scholars cringe.~~ In this essay I explain these two disciplines separately and then collectively `reword this sentance and include time period`. ~~This essay will focus on the mid to late 20th century because this is the time period historical sociology begins being discussed as a discipline.~~ ~~I hope~~ Through this essay the reader will see the importance of exploring other disciplines, especially when writing history `maybe reword`. ~~So much can be taken from other disciplines to add to historical writing. History and sociology are two disciplines that many do not see as being compatible, when in fact; used together they can be very useful.~~ `Last sentance is repetative` 

Historical sociology is the combination of history and sociology which began in the 20th century. The blending of these two subjects enhaces the study and writing of history.

It is very important to understand these two disciplines individually to better understand them ~~collectively~~`use different word other than collectively, maybe combined?`. ~~Historical sociology explains and describes social change.~~ `(put this later)` History ~~alone~~ is defined as the study of the past. Sociology is defined as the study of patterns of social change. `While` both disciplines have narratives that explain and describe `what do they explain and describe?` ~~, however, the difference~~ they differentiate on how ~~is~~ their **data is collected and which methods they implement** to create their narrative. ~~, which differs from discipline to discipline.~~ History~~, as a discipline,~~ creates a narrative through gathering facts, arranging them in chronological order and telling why a specific event matters to us today. Sociology~~, as a discipline,~~ follows the scientific method to test certain variables to understand patterns of social change. `How does istorical sociology collect their data and what methods do they use? If you include historical sociology and define it you need to tie it back in at the end of the paragraph, or delete it entirely.`

Defining history and sociology and their difference in methods and data collection.

Sociology ~~can be~~ `is` seen as the “science of social change”. ~~The~~ `A` sociologist starts by making an observation on a certain social phenomena `starts what?`. A question is formed from this observation and a hypothesis is then formed `reword, reads funny, using formed twice is repeatitve--- A question and then hypothesis is formed from...`. This hypothesis ~~is a prediction that ~~then allows the sociologist ~~to test the hypothesis, or~~ to run an experiment. A conclusion is drawn and added to the narrative. `You're telling the scientific method, maybe just say that instead of going through each step and spend more time talking about what kind of social phenomenon they look at and why. I want to know more about that and what kind of questions they ask then the scientific method` Approaching the world through a scientific lens works for this discipline because in order to make huge claims about the way society works, data needs to be present `reword`. The only way to get this data is to conduct experiments on society itself `is it the only way, or is it the best way or the most efficent way?`. Sociologists may collect data quantitatively or qualitatively, although most choose to use quantitative data because the numbers provide more concrete evidence when the sociologist is making their claim `why does this matter?`. Quantitative methods aim to explain large changes across time `I don't get how this part ties into anything in the beginning`. 

Defining the scientific method within sociology

This **does not mean that qualitative methods should be separated from this discipline.** Qualitative methods focus more on words than on numbers. For example, quantitative sociologists often conduct interviews where the exact words are later put into the sociological paper. Qualitative methods allow for the subjects to be represented by their own words instead of by numbers. This method is much more personal for the researcher as well as the subject, and works best with smaller samples of people. Quantitative methods, on the other hand, work better with larger samples and are less personal for everyone involved. It is not pertinent that these methods stay separate, and in fact many sociologists actually use both methods to create a more complete picture. 

Different schools of thought exist within sociology and often steer the type of research the sociologist is doing. Symbolic interactionism is a school of thought that explains social behavior through the ways in which individuals interact with one another and the social institutions around them (school, work etc.). Functionalism is a school of thought that states society has pieces that all play a distinct role. Lastly, the conflict perspective views society as being in a continuous state of struggle between classes. Karl Marx is the scholar responsible for inventing conflict theory, and therefore is very important to conflict theorists in sociology. 

Marx is an important figure to both sociologists and historians and it is for this reason I am choosing to discuss him in this essay. Karl Marx’s writing during the 19th century focuses heavily on politics and class conflict. He strongly believes in chaos being the result of this class conflict. He also believes that social patterns are what lead to historical change. The fact that he discusses **social issues in relation to historical and political change** shows how these two disciplines can be put together. Marx began the discipline that will eventually become known as Historical Sociology sometime in the 1950’s. 

History is defined as the “study of the past”. What does this mean? How should one study the past? Whereas sociology relies on data, history relies on evidence. The historian must gather evidence in which to base a narrative on. The historian starts by researching a topic that interests them. The research aspect is very important for the historian and therefore must be done carefully and correctly. Next is the thesis statement, or argument, that the historian is trying to make. Good historical narratives have a good argument. 

The 20th century sees many wars and leaves many individuals asking questions about how we, as a country, had gotten ourselves into such a mess. Many historians are expected to make sense of it all or somehow predict what will happen next. In the 1950’s historians began looking for new methods to explain the societal change around them.   This becomes historical sociology, which both explains and describes a social change (Greene, p.3127). Historical sociology differs from other historical disciplines in that it asks questions that go against what we, as a society, think is concrete. What is truth… This characteristic is very Marxist in nature. When collecting data, it is important to record things in the exact order they occurred (temporal order) and look at data across different time periods (longitudinal). Being able to explain how society changes over time is important to this discipline as it provides evidence of the claim. This discipline focuses on actions both of individuals and groups. This characteristic is also very Marxist in nature. Lastly, The main focus of historical sociology is change within society. The historical sociologist is responsible for mapping patterns of change.   

The nature of historical sociology is focused on understanding how societies have formed throughout history and what patterns they follow. Historical sociologists study topics that center on **politics and their power dynamics.** By this point I hope it is apparent why Marx is a huge influence to this discipline. His obsession with this unequal distribution of power raises some very important questions that call for more than just a simple historical narrative. These historical questions can only be answered through first understanding what is taking place in society and why. This is why historical sociologists describe societal patterns in order to aid in their explanation of historical change. One perfect example of a historical sociology narrative comes from Theda Skocpol and discusses what societal patterns lead to revolutions (historical change). 

Theda Skocpol is a female sociologist and political scientist who has written many books ranging in social topics. She is currently a professor at Harvard University. The four characteristics that Skocpol uses to explain historical sociology as a discipline are **1.** asking questions about social phenomenon that go against what we know **2.** longitudinal studies and temporal order matter **3.** actions and structures are what matter and **4.** focus patterns of change (Greene, p.3127).

In her 1997 book titled, **States & Social Revolutions**, Skocpol mentions that revolutions are socio-historical in that it takes great societal issues to arouse a revolution (Greene, 3471). Skocpol begins with a hypothesis before she even begins the historical analysis. She does this because, as she is focusing on agrarian bureaucracies, it is important to understand what societal issues are taking place between classes in order to explain why a revolution begins in the fist place…

In conclusion, both history and sociology are disciplines that have established their place in the academic world separately, not collectively. Still a work in progress.
