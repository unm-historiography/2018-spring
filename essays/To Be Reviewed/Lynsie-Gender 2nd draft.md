## Twenty-First Century Women’s Historiography
#### Lynsie Hojnowski

Historiography regarding gender and women’s history has expanded to almost every aspect of the field since its introduction in the 1960s. Women’s history, as we know it today, has its roots in post-modernism and Second Wave Feminism. The concept of women’s history was truly a paradigm shift, not in methodology or theory, but instead on **whom** could and should be included in historical discourse. This shift not only included women as a subject matter, but also as authors of historiography. **In the twenty-first century, historians’ research in women and gender history expanded to include not only women but other marginalized groups due to the influence of post-modernism, post-colonialism and third wave feminism.**

Highly influential Second Wave feminists such as Gloria Steinem, Catherine MacKinnon, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and Betty Friedan **questioned what it meant to be a _woman_** in the late twentieth century and how women should be able to move throughout the world. These women challenged society to view women as important, which was then translated into the field of history. Second Wave feminism tackled many issues that faced women in academia such as the sexual harassment and discrimination with the creation of Title IX of the Education Amendment Act in 1974. Title IX prohibited women from being excluded from universities or denied financial aid, thus allowing more women to enter the academic sphere. The 1960s and 1970s were times in which students, both male and female, demanded more college curriculum that was pertinent to the issues they faced (Popkin, Jeremy. 2016). _The contributing factors of increased female students in academia, the rise of Second Wave feminism and female independence, and post-modernism created what would become women’s history._

Historians who research gender and women during have hoped to bring more representation to the field, including previously ignored groups. Notably, such groups included those of whom are immigrants, transgender, intersex, and otherwise non-binary and how they interacted within their society. An amazing example of this inclusion is the article by David Rubin, _“’An Unnamed Blank That Craved a Name’: A Genealogy of Intersex as Gender”_. Rubin uses feminist methodology to trace the role intersex played in the development of gender in the twentieth-century biomedicine. He cites many influential historians and theorists such as Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Ann Oakely, and Denise Riley who opened the door to gender and sexuality studies and pushed the boundary even further. As an example of reanalyzing second wave feminism into a new and more expansive theory, Rubin states:
>“While _second-wave feminists_ theorized the social construction of gender to critique the determinist fallacy that “anatomy is destiny,” _feminist and queer scholars have more recently pushed at the limits of gender constructionism_, asking whether the very frame of binary gender naturalizes heteronormativity, sexual dimorphism, and the relations of power that underlie those structures.” (Rubin, David A. 2012. 21)

Riley further continues his analysis of intersex and its history within biomedicine, feminism, and culture to argue that “intersex is actually central to the history of the analytic categories that have fundamentally shaped the diverse intellectual trajectories, paradigms, pedagogies, and politics of the field” (Rubin, David A. 2012. 23). Rubin’s argument would never have come to fruition without the work of historians and theorists who’d come before him challenging the status quo of whom people should consider as historically relevant.

Post-modernism has played a crucial role in the movement of inclusion of otherwise marginalized people. Post-modernism expanded the range of topics and concepts that historians could analyze and discuss. The most influential post-modernist to impact women’s history is Michel Foucault. He is considered the pioneer of gender theory, especially with his work _The History of Sexuality_, published between 1976 and 1984. Foucault’s work had a huge impact within the field and can be seen as an influence in many historian’s work (Harris, Victoria. 2010). **Foucault questioned what sexuality is, how society interacted with it, and challenged many long-held beliefs regarding sexual feelings and actions** (Foucault, Michel. 1974). Foucault’s challenges to the way sexuality had been represented in history created new ways of interpreting and understanding sexuality. This in turn created a whole new world of questions, theories, and contexts within the past that historians could explore and analyze, which still continues today.

Discussions surrounding race and gender in the United States during the 1980s led to a new global perspective of non-Western racial representation. This global awareness had a strong connection with post-modernism as well as post-colonialism. Many articles written regarding gender also include some other intersectional aspect to it, whether it be gender analysis, race, sexuality, or class. Historians also wanted to expand the geographical focus of women who were Middle Eastern, Asian, Latino, and other non-Eurocentric historiographies. Prime examples of these analyses can be seen in _“The 'Masculine' Female: The Rise of Women Doctors in Colonial India, c. 1870–1940”_ by Ambalika Guha, _“Red Lights: The Lives of Sex Workers in Postsocialist China”_ by Tiantian Zheng, and _“Enabling sexual self-fashioning: embracing, rejecting and transgressing modernity among the Iranian Dutch”_ by Rahil Roodsaz and Willy Jansen. While these are just three examples, women’s history and gender analysis have impacted subaltern and post-colonial historiography in an irreversible and symbiotic approach. Within post-colonial and subaltern studies, gender and women are an additional layer of analysis that historians can apply to their research. Both of these methods can exist outside the other, but when combined create a rich and complex history of near-forgotten and excluded figures.

Women’s historiography in the twenty-first century was strongly influenced by third wave feminism and a cultural shift in the 1990s. Third wave feminism gained its identity with the article published in Ms. Magazine, _Becoming Third Wave_, by Rebecca Walker. Walker’s article articulated the challenges that women faced and demanded action from all women to make a societal change:
>I am ready to decide, as my mother decided before me, to devote much of my energy to the history, health, and healing of women…**To be a feminist is to integrate an ideology of equality and female empowerment into the very fiber of my life.** It is to search for personal clarity in the midst of systemic destruction, to join in sisterhood with _women when often we are divided_, to understand power structures with the intention of challenging them… I write this as a plea to all women, especially the women of my generation… that **the fight is far from over.**  (Walker, Rebecca. 1993)

Third-wave feminists felt they had an unfinished work from Second Wave feminism that needed to be addressed, such as sexual harassment and violence against women, as well as inclusion of other marginalized communities (such as minorities and LGBTQ). The inclusion and expansion of other people seen in Third Wave feminism was also seen culturally within the United States. Feminists and historians in the twenty-first century felt a strong sentiment of needed increased representation and inclusion which can be seen throughout women and gender history.

The issues and goals discussed within Third Wave Feminism can be seen throughout scholarship in women and gender history. In 2007, an international conference was convened to discuss the impact of gender in history and the future of the field. Martina Kessel defined gendered historiography in 2007 as: **“the rewriting and gendering of certain fields of history, women writing history, or the writing of women's lives”** (Lindner, Ulrike. 2009. 314). The distinction between of Women and Gender is one of the more notable changes that has developed over the last eighteen years. It is important to remember the distinction between gendered history and gender history. Gender History, while also still related to Women’s history, looks at the relationship between sexuality, identity, masculinity, femininity, etc., in a historical context. While it is common for gender history to be synonymous with women’s history it is crucial to recognize the nuanced difference between the two. _Both are rooted in feminist theory and inspired by feminist movements, however, not all women’s history or female historians are feminist, nor does all feminist history have to be solely about women_

While women’s history and gender history has made huge strides since 2000, there are still many challenges that women in the field of history as well as women’s history faces. One of the challenges of using the lens of women or gender in a historical narrative, or being a female historian, is that the work is then frequently categorized as “feminist”, which is can be synonymous with “radical” (Nair, Janaki. 2008). For example, in Beverly Southgate’s book, _What is History For?_, he digresses from Bonnie Smith’s criticisms of self-gendering history as male with a disclaimer that her argument “may sound initially like the paranoid raving of a latter-day feminist” (Southgate, Beverly. 80).  It is only after this disclaimer that he continues his analysis of Bonnie Smith’s criticisms to argue that gendering the past is one of historian’s hidden agendas.

Not only have women struggled to find recognition in the profession (outside of feminism), but women’s history has struggled to find its place in the historical record. Jeremy Popkin explains in his book, _From Herodotus to H-Net_, “women in history experienced considerable frustration and often outright anger as they pushed to expand their career opportunities and gain recognition with the profession” (Popkin, Jeremy. 2016. 144). Martina Kessle further explains “Women wrote themselves back into the profession, they often did not succeed in writing themselves back into the [national] canon" (Lindner, Ulrike. 2009. 314). Women are more able to participate in the historical profession, while still often being labeled feminist regardless of its methods or theory, and yet women as significant historical figures has yet to come to fruition.

Overall, women’s history and gender history has experienced a growth of subject matter, has expanded its representation of society and included many more marginalized groups than had been considered in its creation. The field still continues to expand to other historical theories and methodologies and has strong roots in its feminist background. In time, not only will women be written back into the canon of history, but other marginalized communities of people. Expanding the scope of history of whom should be included in our historical canon should not be filtered or censored, but encouraged and embraced. Notable female historians to further your research into this field include: Bonnie Smith, Judith Walker, Gerda Lerner, Joan Wallach Scott, Judith Walkowitz, and Natalie Zemon Davis.
