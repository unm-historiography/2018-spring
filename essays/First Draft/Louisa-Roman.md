Conclusion

	Roman Historiography had been influenced by the writings and styles of Herodotus and Thucydides, but had developed within its own way. The emphasis on the empire and its successes is apparent through multiple historian's writings and something that is characteristically Roman at this time. They wrote about the world in the way they understood it: with them being at the center. The creation of the national history genre allowed them to write their history with a complete focus on the Empire, its successes, and those who brought those successes home. This genre of historical writing will extend well past the life of the Romans, as Hitler and other historic figures will use this genre for the same goal that the Romans used it: propaganda. Julius Caesar and Livy's works highlight the emphasis on the superiority of the Romans, although, they are done is very different ways. Ammianus Marcellius's writings also fit into this model as the Roman traditions were stuck to, even in the discussion of religion.
	Roman historiography will extend into future generations of historical writing as Roman historians would provide new models of writing, new focuses on historical material, and new genres, such as national histories, that will be used throughout the time that follows.
