## Early Feminist History and Changes within Historiography 
### First Draft
After World War II, a phenomenon called postmodernism developed, and would soon sweep through the field of historiography. Postmodernism, a move away from the Rankean traditions of the first half of the 20th century, rejected most of the changes to historiography that had come about with the Enlightenment. With this, avenues that had been previously closed now had the ability to make their debut. Along with other histories, women’s history would emerge alongside second wave feminism. Women were “trapped in a present where oppressive social relations appear natural and inevitable. Knowledge of history is knowledge that things have changed and do change” (Green and Troup, pg. 253). While women’s history would arise because of women questioning why their story had been left out of the narrative, it would grow to become an all-encompassing social movement that would look at the larger social relations between men and women. With this change would come a change within historiography. Using the pathways carved out by postmodernism, second-wave feminism would fundamentally change historiography through bringing to light the many male-centric ways that the world was classified through, as well as questioning the traditional ways of thinking about the world. 

Throughout much of history, women were left out of the narrative. In an increasingly postmodernist fashion, historians began to question the relation of women and history. In historiography, women were constantly judged on the same measure as men. Instead of looking at the value of the roles that women played in history, historians often would compare their professions (i.e. homemaker, mother, queen) against the traditional male professions (i.e. king, scientist, banker, lawyer). In Simone de Beauvoir’s groundbreaking essay about the treatment of women throughout history, she states that “[h]umanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself” (Beauvoir, pg. 26). So, while historiography had continued to grow and change, the fundamental thing that stayed the same was the way that historians (at this point, they were mostly male) viewed women. Without questioning their positionality, historians wrote about the role of women in society as a fixed entity, instead of a constantly changing body. The women who were wrote about generally had some characteristic or occupation that was similar to that of a man. Up until second-wave feminism, the categorization of history was generally made up of areas traditionally controlled by males. This lack of female oriented histories made it incredibly difficult to change the status of women throughout history, as it was only being looked at through a male lens. Feminist historians would seek out a larger change to the institutions that perpetuated the unchanging view of women in history: historiography.
