***History Wars: The Battle for the Future of History***

As history became more popular among general public in the late 20th century, the conflict between popular and academic history became a crucial debate for the profession of history. (Popkin, 2016, (p. 153). Historians faced a dilemma: to write a popular or a scholarly history. A work of popular history is written for the purpose of mass audiences while academic or scholarly history is made through objective vigorous scholarly research. While historians who wrote popular histories were more likely to make money off their works, “popular history is often looked down upon by more academically minded historians” (Norton, 2013). The debate between popular and scholarly history will have repercussions on the future of historical studies because “he who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past” (Popkin, 2016, (p. 113). 

In 1960s and 1970s, historians started to cash in on history’s new popularity. Historians such as Pierra Nora, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and George Duby experienced success in marketing their works to mass audiences (Popkin, 2016, (p. 154). George Duby wrote “a century after history withdrew from the marketplace and took refuge behind the opacities of erudition, it now showed renewed interest in the literacy business and the possibility of reaching a wide audience” (Popkin, 2016, (p. 154). The general public fascination with the past did not align with the academic focus of seeking the past through objectivity and strict scrutiny but with a curious interest in flashy topics. For example, British “university historians” attacked the general public’s interest in the “restoration of aristocratic “stately homes”” because it placed an over-emphasis on the lives of the rich and powerful (Popkin, 2016, (p. 154). 

In 1994, the divide between popular and academic history was on full display in the United States when the Smithsonian attempted to bring the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II, to its Washington D.C. museum (Linenthal, 1996). The Enola Gay exhibit was controversial because it was seen by many Republicans and veterans groups as “anti-American” and “projecting the “countercultural values” of the Vietnam era onto America’s last good war” (Linenthal, 1996, (p. 2)). But for academic historians like Beverley Southgate, who did not create the Enola Gay exhibit, the agenda of all modern history should not be to promote national histories but to advocate for “that international community to which now we all belong” (Southgate, 2005, (p. 74)). In this case, not only do the believers of popular and academic history have different viewpoints but they have different values. The Enola Gay exhibit was later discarded by the museum in 1995 but the idea of the exhibit itself struct at the heart of the “History Wars”, a term that drove Edward Linenthal to write the book “History Wars: The Enola Gay and Other Battles for the American Past” (Linenthal, 1996). 

The historical battle over the Enola Gay is not only crucial from a historical standpoint of “to show what actually happened”, as Leopold Von Ranke stated, but it has a profound impact on how America sees its national identity (Popkin, 2016, (p. 76)). While certain examples American popular history glorified America’s role in dropping the atomic bombs in Japan, such as President Truman’s Presidential Library, the consensus among academic historians is to take a more objective perspective by analyzing the devastating impact the atomic bomb had on the Japanese people (The Harry S. Truman Library and Museum, 2018) (Linenthal, 1996 (p. 131)). If the historical consensus is that the United States unnecessarily dropped the atomic bombs, then the United States unjustifiably killed hundreds of thousands of civilians (Linenthal, 1996, (p.79)). If the historical consensus is that the United States was justified in the dropping of the atomic bombs, for which certain United States government reports state that the United States would have lost up to 63,000 soldiers and a popular history museum claimed up to 1 million dead, then the United States was the heroic winner of World War II (Linenthal, 1996, (p. 54-56). 

The issue of the atomic bombings are not the only controversial issues in American History between popular and academic history. The academic historian Anders Stephanson’s book “Manifest Destiny: American Expansionism and the Empire of Right” takes a more critical viewpoint of popular historical viewpoint that glorified America’s westward expansion (Stephanson, 1995). Native American historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz’s book “An indigenous peoples' history of the United States” aggressively attacks the United States for perpetuating a genocide against Indigenous peoples while displacing indigenous tribes of their land due to a settler-colonial mindset (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014). Differing views of United States and indigenous relations have sparked a debate between how America’s views its past. Was the United States’ expansion westward justifiable? Has the United States committed genocide against Indigenous individuals? These questions are at the heart of the battle to define America’s past. 

Due the rise of varying historical viewpoints of America’s past, there are different opinions how should American history should be taught in the classroom and in educational settings. Politicians debated whether how critical the history curriculum should be of America’s past. While “the history wars in the United States often saw academic historians defending a pluralistic approach to the past” that promoted inclusion and backgrounds into different social groups, conservative politicians often thought that academic historians were seeking to promote “politically correctness” (Popkin, 2016, (p. 159)). However, not all academic historians believe that a heavy emphasis on plurality is good for historical studies. Mark Lilla, a historian at Columbia University, attacked the growing trend of identity politics in history by stating that “the achievements of women’s rights movements, for instance, were real and important, but you cannot understand them if you do not first understand the founding fathers’ achievement in establishing a system of government based on the guarantee of rights” (Lilla, 2016). The battle for control of America’s past not only transcends the distinctions between popular and academic history but it is dependent on the debate of what will be included in history curriculums across the country. 

The often lack of separation between popular history and myths has been thoroughly by academic historians. In McNeill’s journal article “Mythistory, or Truth, Myth, History, and Historians”, he attacks national histories for promoting myths that objective historians dismantle (McNeill, 1986). In Southgate’s book “What is History for?”, he claims that one of history’s primary purposes is to break myths (Southgate, 2005, location 947). Southgate claims that “for historians, history is the very antithesis of myth; it’s precisely what myth isn’t it – namely true” (Southgate, 2005, location, 947). During Hitler’s reign in Germany, he promoted a nationalist history of Germany that “united” the Germany people (Southgate, 2005, location 1503). This false “Nazi propaganda” popularized the notion that “Germanic superiority could be traced right back to the earliest times; and the retention of that superiority depended on the maintenance of racial purity” (Southgate, 2005, location 1517). German nationalist historians spread the false notion that the Jews were responsible for “spreading the bubonic plague” and hindering the economic capabilities of lower income individuals (Southgate, 2005, location 1517). Hitler used these false historical viewpoints to gain support for his attempts at conquest and empire during World War II. Hitler’s nationalist history case study is a perfect example of why we need objective historians that are able to bring a scholarly perspective of the past. 

Even though popular history has its faults, its lack of emphasis on objectivity and vigorous research, it provides a valuable benefit to society. An academic historian, David Lowenthal, expressed his support for popular history, specifically “Disneyland’s talking Abraham Lincoln”, stated that “better a misinformed enjoyment of history than none, a lighthearted dalliance with the past than a wholesale rejection of it” (Popkin, 2016, (p. 155)). Lowenthal is correct in his assessment of popular history because is beneficial for the history profession to have a greater audience. While Disneyland’s interpretation of Abraham Lincoln may not be the most critical or in-depth, it gives the general public a broad understanding of one of America’s most important presidents and historical figures. Dangerous aggressive national narratives like the one promoted by Hitler’s Germany should be quickly identified and combatted for the betterment of the world but the history profession should not loose potential consumers because an intellectual elite is upset that a “lighthearted” historical representation is not scholarly enough (Popkin, 2016, (p. 155)). In Southgate’s “What is History For?”, he claims that all history has an agenda and it is unreasonable for a historian to be completely objective and “consider all angles” (Southgate, 2005, (location 356 & 648)). If scholarly historians even admit to academic history’s shortcomings, are scholarly historians being unfair in their criticism of popular history? 

The future of the “History Wars” is one of the most crucial topics in history profession because it is deeply intertwined with other key historical trends and themes (Popkin, 2016, (p. 153)). The concept of “History Wars” expands beyond just distinctions between popular and academic history and which historical method will become more commonly used by future historians. Will Marxist history, objective history, feminist histories, nationalist history and historical sociology become more commonly used in academic curriculums or be taught with greater emphasis in history departments across the globe? Historians have to decide if they are going to compose their historical work for mass audiences with less of an emphasis on objectivity or if that work is made for scholarly purposes. “History Wars” have academic, political and social ramifications on how the public views the past and more importantly which historical narratives will prevail in the future.
