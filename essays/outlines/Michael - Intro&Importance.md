- Intent of this Collection
  - Provide a modest look into important themes of historiography, complied by students of history, each with their own fields of interest and expertise. While some areas of examination are traditional and expected to be included in a compilation of historiographical insight, other areas are commonly overlooked or neglected by academics.
  - Through our research and focused work, each historian will demonstrate knowledge and perspective gained from the course and, more broadly, from a lifetime of history education.
  - What do we bring to the academic community? How is this collection organized?

- Topics to be covered in the Collection:
  - List, group, and describe topics to be covered (once finalized and confirmed)
  - _Example_: Historiography and gender have come a long way since academics first began framing the importance of women in history. In 1986, Joan W. Scott detailed the importance of including gender diversity in the historic record. However, in reading her once-profound perspective, any millennial academic would be remiss not to notice her binary approach to the discussion. In rethinking and rewriting gender history, the modern historian must consider the spectrum of genders in order to be best representative and most accurate.
