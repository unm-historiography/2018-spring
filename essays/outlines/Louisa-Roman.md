**Roman Historiography**

My introduction will include:
1. Brief introduction into the Roman world as they knew it
2. Brief overviews of the specific historians I will talk about?
3. Highlight important themes that will be covered in the essay
4. My thesis


I want to include a brief overview of **Herodotus and Thucydides** since they had *"...provided important models for subsequent historians in the ancient Greek and Roman world and for their successors ever since"* (Popkin, 29). While Herodotus and Thucydides were not Roman; they had an impact how future Roman historians approached historical writing. Possibly discussing the critiques or challenges faced by Herodotus and Thucydides for their models (how much of the source is the truth and how much is myth?). (Make sure that this is extremely brief)!!

I want to talk about how **Roman religion** impacted how they wrote and understood their history. Their religion was at the center of their lives and impacted how they viewed the world around them. *"The Greek and Roman historians were not modern rationalists: they lived in a world that believed in various supernatural powers and took omens seriously"* (Popkin, p.35). This might be the best place to discuss Ammianus Marcellinus, as he took a religious (pagan) apprach to his writing! Should I include Christianity?

**Polybius**, is known as the *"father of Roman history"* (Kelley, p. 52), who had wrote his Roman history from the foundation of the city onward. It would be his successors that would create the historical genre of *"**national histories**, the story of a single political community over an extended period of time. From Polybius onward, historians of Rome were drawn to the question of the causes of that state's extraordinary success..."** (Popkin, p.32). 

I will talk about **Livy**, or the *"founder of histories"* (Popkin, p. 52). His historical works include topics such as, *"military, political, and institutional history"* (Kelley, p. 56). He also spoke of the challenges historians face as they attempt to recreate history; some of which, are still concerns today, such as the lack of written sources. 

**Tactius** is the last Roman historian I want to include in my writing. He wrote during the decline of the empire in the 2nd century that attempted to explain why and what was causing the empire to fall. Instead of writing under the Herodotus model, he strove "to tell "no story to excite wonder; I do but relate what I have heard and what our father's recorded" (Kelley, p. 63)

**Oral history** was a common practice throughout the Roman Empire since *"Written history was the preserve of a small, cultivated elite"* (Popkin, p. 35) Many people living in the lower classes of Roman society wouldn't have had a proper education that would have taught them to read Greek and Latin; nor did they have the money to buy books/manuscripts as they were expensive!

(Class Discussion Notes/Improvements To Be Made: Make sure when I am talking about Herodotus and Thyucdides - keep it very short, there is an essay that will address they at length, only talk about the effects they had on Roman historians. Note the important changes that were utilized by the Roman historians, make them an example of something larger!! Need to make sure that I note the Historiographical shifts that occurs. Not format my essay according to the people, but organize it through the shifts or changes that they embrace in their writing! Include what this section contributes to the future of the historic writing, what makes it so important to know?)

I haven't been able to complete any outside research as I am waiting for my chosen articles to come through the InterLibrary Loan. Due to the waiting, I have yet to finish my thesis but I will hopefully be able to do that Wednesday! I would love to know if there are any other specific historians that need to be included! I picked 3-4 and don't know if that will give me enough information for 1500 words since my outside sources have not gotten to me yet. Are there any major themes/figures that I forgot? I might include a discussion on Jewish and Christianity within Roman Historiography
