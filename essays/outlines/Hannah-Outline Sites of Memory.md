## Outline Sites of Memory

- **Introduction**

- I will be focusing on sites of memory that people interact with in their everyday lives and how that changes their view of history. As well as how history becomes a memory and how group/collective memory changes overtime. How our view of history is changed or viewed differently as a result of group or family memory.

- "Sites of memory are places where groups of people engage in public activity through which they express 'a collective shared knowledge... of the past, on which a group's sense of unity and individuality is based'"**(Winter p.312)**

- I have found a large number of articles that talk about sites of memory, history and how it has been covered in historiography. A few look at the Holocaust and Jewish memory and history, also the Smithsonian exhibition that included parts of Enola Gay.


- I found this quote really interesting, that the sites of memory are often focused on events that were horrible and how they can help new generations connect  to the past. "The critical point about sites of memory is that they are there as points of reference not only for those who survived traumatic events, but also for those born long after them" **(Winter, p.313)**.


- I would like to write a few paragraph that talk about the sites of memory we pass in our everyday lives and how it changes the way we view history. From both a personal and group point of view/identity.  

- I am having a much harder time finding articles about the politics of artifacts. There a number of articles that talk about particular item but I am not sure what I should focus on regarding politics of artifacts. Or should I just write about sites of memory? I have plenty of articles on sites of memory. Any ideas?
