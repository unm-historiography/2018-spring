# *The History Wars: Popular and Scholarly History*

•	As history grew in popularity in the 20th century, historians faced a dilemma: to write a popular or a scholarly history. **While popular history has a greater audience, “popular history is often looked down upon by more academically minded historians” (Norton, 2013).** Academic or scholarly history is designed to be more objective and result from more rigorous research while popular history is designed to reach mass audiences (Popkin, 2016 (p. 153). 

•	The “History Wars” between popular and scholarly history became a key historical phenomenon in the 1960s and 1970s (Popkin, 2016, (p. 160).  Historians such as Pierra Nora, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and George Duby experienced success in marketing their works to mass audiences. **Popular history reinvigorated the public’s interest with history** (Popkin, 2016, (p. 154)). 

•	In 1986, the academic historian George McNeill wrote a journal article called “mythistory” that attacked certain popular histories for perpetuating false narratives (McNeill, 1986). McNeill explained that national histories that promoted “mythistories” were dangerous because they heightened conflicts among various ethnic and national groups. 

•	**How do politicians interject themselves in the historical debate?** Influential politicians like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan criticized academic history for not accurately presenting the past (Popkin, 2016, (p. 156). President Reagan’s administration waged a cultural war on “political correctness” in academic history. How did these political movements impact the line between scholarly and popular history?

•	In 1996, Edward Linenthal’s book *History Wars: The Enola Gay and Other Battles for the American Past* raised questions about societal perspectives of America’s past. **Linenthal’s book re-examines mainstream popular history that portrays the United States as the good guys.** For example, he looks at the dropping of the Atomic Bonds in Japan and the idea of America “taming of the west” (Linenthal, 1996). 

•	**How does popular and scholarly history promote a culture war in the United States?** Was it Manifest Destiny for the United States to expand to the west coast? Did the United States commit a genocide against Native American communities and tribes? Is the United States an imperialist empire or is America truly exceptional? How should academia and schools teach these subjects? These questions are controversial topics and are embedded in the bedrock of American history. 

•	Like many other corporations, Disney has used popular history for commericial purposes. Their representations of Pocahontas and Abraham Lincoln reached far larger audiences than the individual works of scholarly historians but they also misrepresent historical figures (Popkin, 2016, p. 155). Is popular history a productive and good contributor to American society or is it harmful to the American public?  

•	**How will future generations handle the distinctions from popular and academic history?** Can these two methods of history come together? Which method of history will become more commonly used by historians?
