Foucault Outline 
*The Postmodern experiment of narrative*
  • The examination of narrative in history has brought to question the need to understand the implicit value of language in our writing.
  •	The evolution of historical method has reflected years of questioning the very purpose of history.
  •	Michel Foucault ironically spearheaded the postmodern movement to reexamine the purpose of history itself, examining the categorical bias we impose or simply allow in our daily lives
  •	The rise of postmodernist philosophy has taken apart the established belief that there is a definitive narrative, a complete story of humanity that can be told. The belief in a grand narrative had formed the large majority of modern discourse on history. 

*The bricks of our past*
  •	There is an outstanding belief in grand narrative of history, an idea that humanities past can be easily categorized and remembered in a well-structured collaborative archive. The belief against a purely structured history formed a deconstructionist philosophy centered on using the past outside of a predetermined “house” built by previous historians. 
  •	The new analytical format was akin to more a cloud rather than a house itself. 
  
*The structure of nothing*
  •	Do the often dubious task of understanding meaning in the complexity of history, postmodernism posited a theoretical basis for abstractly thinking about meaning. In the postmodern sense: nothing means nothing and our personal understanding is deeply influenced our own understanding of language and the world around us. 
  
*The purpose of it all*
  •	Met with controversy, postmodernism runs the risk of being to abstract to pull academic reliability from so what’s even the purpose? 
  •	Run comparison between Foucault and another historical work, you’ll see a massive difference in meaning of their work. It relates to the difference in theory vs execution, analytic fact vs fictional half-truth. Meaning is in the eye of the author and the reader separately and we can pull meaning where none exists to find profound new elements of society that we had simply just accepted to be cold stagnant fact.
