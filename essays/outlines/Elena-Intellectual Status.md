Intellectual Status Outline

**Intro:**

* I will begin the essay by explaining how present-day students, teachers, academics, etc. are used to a world where history is a serious and well established field of study, segueing into how that was not always the case.

**Main Idea #1:**

* Before professionalization, history was treated as a subcategory of philosophy or literature (Popkin, p. 78-79). This section will serve as a survey of historiography before the nineteenth century. I will mention historiographical methods of Ancient Greece, Rome, and Europe in the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and the Enlightenment. Since some of my classmates will be writing essays on said eras, I will keep my discussion brief but informative. 

**Main Idea #2:**

* This section will be all about Leopold Ranke’s methods and contributions to historiography, and how said methods and contributions helped to establish history as an academic discipline in its own right: making it more “scientific” as opposed to speculative, reconstructing past events from primary sources, and critical examination of sources, all while not judging history according to contemporary principles (Popkin, p. 76-78; Gil, p. 383-384).

**Main Idea #3:**

* This section will examine history and historiography following professionalization. It will cover the later nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Like with the first main idea section, I will have to work around some topics so as not to take away from classmates who will be writing on history of memory, the “history wars,” etc. However, I will discuss how history expanded into professional institutions such as the American Historical Association and museums (Popkin, p. 91-94), nationalist histories (Popkin, p. 82-83), and other notable developments. 

**Conclusion:**

* Restate main ideas and thesis (still a work in progress) to create a concise conclusion.

**Disclaimer:**

* This essay will focus on Western historiography. All semester we have discussed how Western-centric historiographical traditions and methods are, and I will be guilty of that. There is just so much to cover with Western historiography, and I would rather write about something that I have plenty of sources than on something that I would be out of my element on.
