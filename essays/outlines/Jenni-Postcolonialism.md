(I know my outline style is a little different than most of yours, please be patient with me)

1)	Separating colonial viewpoints from precolonial history
- Set up
- Euro-centric viewpoints: define, establish(?)
- "postcolonial" term: really post? (often times no)
2)	Why it’s important (merits of looking from **outside** Euro-centric view)
- Useful/necessary for shedding bias (from Euro-centric viewpoint) 
3)	Can a true postcolonial history be written by someone outside the society?
- Different sides/culture think differently: some yes (Indigenous Americans, Pacific Islanders), some no
- Necessary to shed Euro-centric bias (as much as possible)

Evidence:
- Eurocentric views often ignore problems caused by colonization in histories: "...engaged in complex negotiations over the return of land and naturals resources." _(Houses, 278)_
- "Historians in these countries play a key role in reconstructing the historical process of land alienation." _(Houses, 278-9)_ (Historians help establish what life was like before colonization, which helps the political process of "decolonization:" the withdrawl of colonial forces, hopefully, with the goal of the colonized people regaining their power/independence.) 
- "The Angel of Progress", McClintock (p.259): "Postcolonial" doesn't actually mean after colonization usually.
- leadership/postcolonial historian divergence? _(Houses, 279)
- Orientalism intersection _(Houses, p, 279,280)_: Europeans categorized peoples they conquered- the "orient" as a generalization about everything _not_ Europe, viewed as politically unchanging, socially cruel (binary opposite of Europe), justifiable to exploit
- "Postcolonial historical writing in the past twenty years has developed these two critiques of imperialism and colonialism by deconstructing colonialist discourses, and reconstructing the appalling scale of loss experienced by colonized and indigenous peoples." _(Houses, 281)_
- _The Nation and its Fragments_, Partha Chatterjee _(p. xi)_: Eurocentric history views colonialism as part of capitalist development, "European grand narrative of modernization"
- "The Postcolonial Aura", Arif Dirlik. _(p. 329)_: The goal of postcolonial history is to reestablish societies as complex, rather than the colonial views of them as part of binaries (and maybe also simplistic? tied with the generalizations).
- One method of postcolonial history: (essentialism) Colonized peoples can only combat colonization  by returning to pre-colonization ways of life. _(Houses, 282)_
- Another: (Subaltern) rexamination of colonialism through modern methods, history written from the perspective of small elite class, rewrite now from other, multiple perspectives. _(Houses, 283)_ (representation as a problem being addressed)
- In some places, "possessive exclusivism" is employed- only the colonized should write pre-colonial history (Houses, 282)
- "Questions of Multi-culturalism," Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (p.62-3): Postcolonial histories can be written by non-colonized people.
- Chakraborty: way forward is through critical engagement with concepts that legitimize nation-state _(Houses, 284)_
- One of the difficulties of postcolonial history is interaction with western ideas/sources. writing relies on source usage that societies may not have, or only have access to Western-produced sources. _(Houses, 284-5)_
- "Third, postcoloniality has now come to refer to much more than the third world; it is a generalized condition that affects cultural, especially literary, representations across any divide between metropolitan and provincial, and thus includes many first-world countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and others." _(Krishna, 86)_
- "Although many postcolonial theorists may have once had strong intellectual foundations in Marxism, in recent decades they have clearly been more inspired by the antihumanist thought of Foucault and Derrida, drawing as the latter do from Nietzsche. The critique of essentialism is now accompanied by a suspicion of emancipatory and teleological thought. Together these have been combined into a larger critique of the project of modernity and of “Enlightenment values” in general. All this has incapacitated the struggle against religious fundamentalism, political authoritarianism, and the forces that drive neoliberal globalization in places like India." _(Krishna, 89)_ (def of postcolonial theory, connections to other work/essays, effects. Nice, bulky coverage.)
-  "A disturbing aspect of postcolonial science studies is that for some of its adherents, the content of science does not matter. For them science studies can thrive minus the science. The consequences of this mentality are of great interest because of its distortion of the nature of the scientific enterprise. This seriously undermines the credibility of the postcolonial discourse in the realm of science." _(Dasgupta, 43)_
- " Moreover, as interpreted by postmodernists, a paradigm-candidate becomes the (dominant or ruling) paradigm not by the force of logic or reason alone but by a socio-political process: by the persuasive powers exerted by one community of scientists over others. And so the scientific beliefs held to be true at any point of historical time are not a matter of evidence or reason, but of the exercise of power or influence or coercion._(Dasgupta, 43)_
- "...and because the study of this epistemology is of concern not just to sociologists of science- other scholars such as historians, philosophers, psychologists, cultural theorists and feminist theorists contribute to its nurture and growth - it has acquired a more encompassing name of its own: _science studies_..." _(Dasgupta, 44)_
- " Postcolonialism signifies a certain mentality or cognitive style, harboured (usually but not exclusively) by people of formerly colonial societies: a way of thinking about the experiences, culture and nature of colonised Science Studies sans Science or formerly colonised societies that challenges, contests, even demolishes the dominant Western way of thinking about such colonised socities." _(Dasgupta, 44-45)_
-  "Postcolonialism is thus a special case of postmodernism in that postcolonial theorists reject the colonising culture's discourses and master narratives about colonised societies and posit alternative discourses from a variety of standpoints that were/are ignored or overlooked by the dominant (Western/coloniser's) discourse. _(Ashcroft, Griffiths and Tiffin, eds. 1995, p. 2)_
