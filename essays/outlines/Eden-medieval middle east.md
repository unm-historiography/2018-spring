# Medieval Middle Eastern Historiography 

* **Thesis**: I am going to focus on **three** historians: al-Tabari, al-Athir, and Ibn Khaldun from the 10th-14th century of the Common Era. These three Islamic historians are often **overlooked and unrepresented** in the historiographical narrative, yet they all offered unique contributions to the way medieval Middle Eastern history is understood today.

* (915 C.E.) **al-Tabari**: Arabic historiography has been primarily Islamic, rooted in religion, and often begins with the Islamic creation of Adam. Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Jarīr al-Ṭabarī (839-923 C.E.) was a Persian Islamic scholar. 

* (1231 C.E.) **Ibn al-Athir**: Historian during Crusading period, chronicler of Salah ad-Din entire world history called *Al-Kamil fi al-Tariq* or *The Complete History* which starts with the Islamic creation of Adam to time contemporary for al-Athir. Born in Mosul in May 1160, ibn-Athir was in the city when Salah ad-Din besieged the town in 1185 (Mallett, p. 243).

* (1377 C.E.) **Ibn Khaldun**: Major contributions to historiography, most notably *The Muqaddimah* which serves as an introduction to world history. This introduction to world history has many Greco-Islamic philosophical terminology (Dale, p. 433). In *The Muqaddimah*, Ibn Khaldun "asserts history is--or should be, rooted in wisdom and philosophy" and the readers "must analyze the past rather than just reporting events" (p. 433).
