# Ancient Historiography Outline

**Thesis:** What happened before Herodotus? Does ancient history have the same authority or authenticity as Post-Grecian history? Would some ancient history need to be deemed Non-Western? Why aren't these traditions covered in historiographical texts? (I normally don't actually type out the "thesis statement" until after I've written a bulk of my paper)
- Histriographical Traditions of Pre-written History
1. Persian
2. Egyptian
3. Mesopotamian
4. General "African" historiography and how its traditions differ from the established civilizations we normally learn about
5. Explanation of why these civilizations, and why--despite having systems of writing--I am considering their histories "pre-written history"
- How & Why Written History and Literacy Rates Changed Historiography
1. *Time in Ancient Historiography* by Arnaldo Momigliano shows the difference in the accuracy of events after the ability to write spreads
2. "Literacy rates" in the modern sense could be confusing when thinking about the oral traditions we associate with ancient times, in places like Egypt early antiquity literacy is measured by the types of events that were recorded--only religious events, or things that happened with the common people, etc.
3. Why did history develop in ancient times? What was it's purpose?
- What Were Herodotus' Direct Influences & Their Traditions
1. Persia
2. India
3. Egypt
- Greek Historiography & How it Changed the World
1. Standardization of writng about events is supplemented by the creation of the Julian Calendar under Julius Caesar
2. Greek authority over historical traditions and how they were established
