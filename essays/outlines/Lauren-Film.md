### Very Basic Outline: Film & Other Nontextual Sources of History

**Thesis:**
When watching a film or documentary, as an average person, you are immersively placed into a moment in history that reading a text can never accomplish. Raw footage of historical events can be arguably more objective. We can identify (assuming the footage wasn’t doctored) that the events being filmed did in fact happen. Film can also be more relatable, the ability to look into the eyes of people from the past makes it easier to understand what those individuals went through. Texts are unable to do this as impactfully. Humans are creatures ruled by their senses, various forms of media provoke an emotional response. Song and art can invoke passion, photography can capture iconic moments which on their own can alter the “course of history”, films about history bring it to life and help viewers better relate to the past. Nontextual sources of history are uniquely capable of communicating the emotional impact of historical events.

**Points to make/rough paragraphs:**
- Discussing of the history of film itself leading into how film, particularly film in the style of documentaries became associated with representing the past.
- Value of film for history. Documenting wars, political and social events, crimes against humanity. Connections to cultural history.
- Paragraph addressing photography as a medium. Historical photographs of Vietnam affecting political history for example. Still photography capturing moments in time, being used to compare past with the present.
- Criticism and potential problems. Photos and film can be altered, how hard is it to discern this? Art and song are not always based on fact. Emotions and memories can be flawed. Commentary of the exact same raw footage can completely alter the meaning and narrative of that film, images taken out of context, propaganda, etc.

- Wrap up and tying everything together. Trying to argue that despite the criticisms, nontextual forms of historical knowledge are essential for our understanding of the past.

**Notes:** 
This is an extremely rough outline of what I want to discuss in the essay and I still need to rewrite the thesis. I don’t feel like it’s very clear yet. I’m still in the process of gathering my sources and sorting through them, so specific citations are basically out the window at the moment.
