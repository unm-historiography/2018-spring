**I. Historical Sociology and Anthroplogy**
    
**A. Marxism transition to the Annales school- 19th Century** 

-    After World War II historians developed a new methodology of understanding history, Annales, which relied on empirical evidence and used cultural material as evidence associated with Anthropology to understand societies.   
- "while historians charted the rise of nations, anthropologist traced the cultural and social evolution of mankind" (Houses p.172)
- Where Marxism emphasised class disparities anthropology sought to, "redirect historians' attention away from the public, political sphere of human action towards private, daily life, by rediscovering old sources, including oral history and tradition." (Houses, p. 174)
- _Sir Edward Burnett Tylor_ (1890's) "the founder of academic anthropology" 
-- defined Culture: "taken in its wide ethnographic sense is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits aquired bty man as a member of society." (Houses, p. 172)
- **Franz Boas** (1890's) "Father of American (cultural) Anthropology"
-- "established that race, culture, and language were seperate aspects of human existence" (Houses, p. 173)

-- In 1904 when addressing the _International Congress of Arts and Science_ in St. Louis, regarding the history of anthropology he states, " We find in anthropol- ogy two distinet methods of researeh and aims of investigation: the one, the historie- al method, whiGh endeavors to reGonstruet the aetual history of mankind; the other, the generalizing method, whiGh attempts to establish the laws of its development." (p.514)

-- " During the second half of the eighteenth eentury we find the fundamental Goneept of anthropology well formulated by the ra- tionalists who preteded the Preneh Revolu- tion. The deep-seated feeling that politiGal and sotial inequality was the result of a £aulty development of eivilization and that orlginally all men were born equal." (p. 514)

-- " Thus we find about the middle of the nineteenth eentury the beginnings of an- thropology laid from three distinet points of view: the historiGal, the elassifieatory and the geographical." (p.515)

-- " Anthropology also felt the quickening impulse of the historic point of view, and its development followed the same lines that may be observed in the history of the other science." (p. 516)

-- "s. An- thropology, whiGh was hardly beginning to be a science, ceased at the same time to lose its character of being a single science, but became a method applicable to all the mental sciences and indispensable to all of them. We are still in the midst of this development." (p.517)

-- "le social environment of which language is part. Owing to the rapid thange of language, the historical treatment of the linguistic prob- lem had developed long before the historie aspeet of the natural seienees was under- stood. The genetic relationship of language." (p.518)

-- "The growth of language and all ethnie phenomena have thus been treated from the point of view of a soeial psyehology, and  speeial attention has been given to the subeonseious influenees whieh sway crowds and masses of people, and to the proeesses of imitation." (p. 520)

-- "Though the anthropo- logical point of view may thus pervade the treatment of an older branch of science and help to develop new standpoints, the assistance that anthropology renders it does not destroy the independence of the older science which in a long history has developed its own aims and methods." (p.523)

- _Emile Durkheim_ (1860's) "British (social) anthropology"
-- "the social group or community took precedence over the individual. Human behaviour is fundementally shaped by the moral, religious and social society in which the individual lives." (Houses, p. 173)

**B. Annales to Functionalism- 20th Century**

- _Bronisław Kasper Malinowski_
-- "Participant observation" (Houses, p. 172)

- **Alfred Radcliffe-Brown_  and _Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard** (British Anthropology)
-- " MARETT LECTURE OF I950, Professor Evans-Pritchard told us that 'social anthro- pology is a kind of historiography, and therefore ultimately of philosophy or art, . . . that it studies societies as moral systems and not as natural systems, that it is interested in design rather than in process, and that it therefore seeks patterns and not scientific laws, and interprets rather than expains." In response Radcliffe-Brown states, "In the primitive societies that are studied by social anthropology there are no historical records' (Radcliffe-Brown I952, P. 3); and 'confusions amongst anthropologists result from the failure to distinguish between historical explanation of institutions and theoretical understanding." (p.73)

-- " It is equally erroneous to treat written records as synonymous with history, or to assume that their absence indicates an absence of history." (p. 73) Thus, "history does not relate all the actions done by all men in all past time, but only some actions done by some, men at some known time and place." 

-- " single term 'history' has three distinct references: some series of past events, our knowledge of these past occurrences, and our record of this knowledge. Therefore, the historical status of the past is thus problematic only in so far as our knowledge of it is in doubt." (p. 74) "The historicity of a statement about the past is its evidential trustworthiness, and this in turn implies verifiable reference to events which occurred at a given time and place."

-- " Historical significance has two main conditions, namely, relevance and accuracy." (p. 74) 

-- * "The accept- ability of a historical explanation depends on the fullness and reliability of the record.... Anthropologists, thinking of their study as a kind of historical study, fall back on con- jecture and imagination, and invent "pseudo-historical" or "pseudo-causal" explanations." (p. 75)

--  with functional theory and method= 'problems of social development can only be studied in terms of history' (p. 6o). Accord- ingly the view of 'functional anthropologists that it is not (their) task . .. to investigate the history of the societies they study, and furthermore that a knowledge of their history does not help us to understand the functioning of their institutions' (p. 59), is a simple refusal to test this theory in the only appropriate way, and represents an explicit rejec- tion of scientific method." (p. 78)

-- " social anthropology 'studies societies as moral, or symbolic, systems and not as natural systems, that it is less inter- ested in process than in design, and that it therefore seeks patterns and not laws, demon- strates consistency and not necessary relations . . ., and interprets rather than explains." (p. 79)

-- "'functionalist claim that the history of an institution is irrelevant to an understanding of it at the present time." (p. 80)

-- " the method of both historiography and social anthropology is descriptive integration" "seeks patterns rather than laws, and interprets rather than explains." (p. 80)

-- " history alone provides a satisfactory situation in which the hypotheses of functional anthropology can be tested." (p. 81) 

-- Brown= "nction as 'the contribution which a partial activity makes to the total activity of which it is part." (p. 82)

- _Clifford Geertz_ 
-- "interpretive archaeology" 

**C. Ethnohistory- 20th Century from 1950**

- _W. C. Sturtevant_ 
-- "Ethnohistory encompasses archaeology, ethnology, history and lingustics, and the source materials available to the enthnohistorian include folklore, oral tradition, maps, paintings, and artefacts, as well as written sources" (Houses, p. 175)
- _Natalie Zemon Davis_ 
-- What historians can learn from anthropologist: 
    1. close observation of living processes of social interaction
    2. interesting ways of interpreting symoblic behaviour
    3. suggestions about how the parts of a social system fit together
    4. material from cultures vey different from those which historians are used to studying (Houses, p. 177)
