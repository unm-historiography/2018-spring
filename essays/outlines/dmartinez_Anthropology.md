Desiree' Martinez

**I. Historical Sociology and Anthroplogy**
    
**A. Marxism transition to the Annales school** 

-    After World War II historians developed a new methodology of understanding history, Annales, which relied on empirical evidence and used cultural material as evidence associated with Anthropology to understand societies.   
- "while historians charted the rise of nations, anthropologist traced the cultural and social evolution of mankind" (Houses p.172)
- Where Marxism emphasised class disparities anthropology sought to, "redirect historians' attention away from the public, political sphere of human action towards private, daily life, by rediscovering old sources, including oral history and tradition." (Houses, p. 174)
- _Sir Edward Burnett Tylor_ (1890's) "the founder of academic anthropology" 
-- defined Culture: "taken in its wide ethnographic sense is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits aquired bty man as a member of society." (Houses, p. 172)
- _Franz Boas_ (1890's) "Father of American (cultural) Anthropology"
-- "established that race, culture, and language were seperate aspects of human existence" (Houses, p. 173)
- _Emile Durkheim_ (1860's) "British (social) anthropology"
-- "the social group or community took precedence over the individual. Human behaviour is fundementally shaped by the moral, religious and social society in which the individual lives." (Houses, p. 173)

**B. Annales to Functionalism- 20th Century**

- _Alfred Radcliffe-Brown_ (British Anthropology)
- _Bronis≈Çaw Kasper Malinowski_
-- "Participant observation" (Houses, p. 172) 
- _Clifford Geertz_ 
-- "interpretive archaeology" 

**C. Ethnohistory- 20th Century from 1950**

- _W. C. Sturtevant_ 
-- "Ethnohistory encompasses archaeology, ethnology, history and lingustics, and the source materials available to the enthnohistorian include folklore, oral tradition, maps, paintings, and artefacts, as well as written sources" (Houses, p. 175)
- _Natalie Zemon Davis_ 
-- What historians can learn from anthropologist: 
    1. close observation of living processes of social interaction
    2. interesting ways of interpreting symoblic behaviour
    3. suggestions about how the parts of a social system fit together
    4. material from cultures vey different from those which historians are used to studying (Houses, p. 177)
