# Historical Sociology
## Mikaylah Simpson


Historical Sociology is its own discipline that focuses on change in societies and allows the scholar to understand the historical reasoning behind societal change. History and sociology are two disciplines that many do not see as being compatible, when in fact used together these disciplines can be can be very useful. In this essay I explain these two disciplines separately and then collectively during the mid to late twentieth century. Through this essay you will see the importance of exploring other disciplines when writing history. 

It is very important to understand these two disciplines individually to better understand them combined. History is defined as the study of the past. Sociology is defined as the study of patterns of social change. While both disciplines have narratives that explain and describe social change. They differentiate on how their **data is collected and which methods they implement** to create their narrative. History creates a narrative through gathering facts, arranging them in chronological order and telling why a specific event matters to us today. Sociology follows the scientific method to test certain variables to understand patterns of social change. Historical sociology explains and describes social change first by hypothesizing about social phenomena and explaining the theory by using historical evidence of social change.

Sociology is seen as the “science of social change”. A sociologist starts the research process by making an observation on a certain social phenomena. A question is posed from this observation and a hypothesis is then formed based on the expected answer to the research question. This hypothesis is a prediction that allows the sociologist to experiment on this prediction. A conclusion is drawn and added to the narrative. Approaching the world through a scientific lens works for this discipline because in order to make large claims about the way society works, data needs to be present.

The most efficient way to get this data is to conduct experiments on society itself. Sociologists may collect data quantitatively or qualitatively, although most choose to use quantitative data because the numbers provide more concrete evidence when the sociologist is making their claim. It is not pertinent that these methods stay separate, and in fact many sociologists actually use both methods to create a more complete picture.Quantitative methods aim to explain large changes across time. This **does not mean that qualitative methods should be separated from sociology.** Qualitative methods focus more on words than on numbers. For example, quantitative sociologists often conduct interviews where the exact words are later put into their sociological paper. Qualitative methods allow for the subjects to be represented by their own words instead of by numbers. This method is much more personal for the researcher and subject, and works best with smaller samples of people. Quantitative methods, on the other hand, works better with larger samples and are less personal for everyone involved. It is not pertinent that these methods stay separate, and in fact many sociologists actually use both methods to create a more complete picture_.

Different schools of thought exist within sociology and often steer the type of research a sociologist is doing. Understanding these schools of thought helps us better understand how the sociological framework of historical sociology works. Symbolic interactionism is a school of thought that explains social behavior through the ways in which individuals interact with one another and the social institutions around them (school, work etc.). Functionalism is a school of thought that states society has pieces that all play a distinct role. Lastly, the conflict perspective views society as being in a continuous state of struggle between classes. Karl Marx is the scholar responsible for inventing conflict theory, and therefore is very important to conflict theorists in sociology.

Marx is an important figure to both sociologists and historians. Karl Marx’s writing during the nineteenth century focuses heavily on politics and class conflict. He strongly believed in chaos being the result of this class conflict. He also believed that social patterns were what lead to historical change. The fact that he discussed **social issues in relation to historical and political change** showed how these two disciplines can be combined. Marx began the discipline that will eventually become known as Historical Sociology during the 1950s.

History is defined as the “study of the past”. What does this mean? How should one study the past? Whereas sociology relies on data, history relies on evidence. Data refers to factual information that relies on numbers, whereas evidence refers to facts that are meant to support an argument. A historian must gather evidence in which to base their narrative. The historian starts by researching a topic that interests them. The research aspect is very important for the historian and therefore must be done carefully and correctly. Next is the thesis statement, or argument, that the historian is trying to make. Good historical narratives have a good argument.

The twentieth century experienced many wars and left many individuals asking questions about how we had gotten ourselves into such a mess. Many historians were expected to help society make sense of it all. In the 1950s historians continued looking for new methods to explain the societal change around them. What historians developed in response to the societal changes they had experienced became known as historical sociology (Green and Troup,1999, p.3127). Historical sociology differs from other historical disciplines in that it asks questions that go against what we, as a society, think is concrete. This characteristic is very Marxist in nature because it challenges what society thinks it knows. When collecting data, it is important to record events in the exact order they occurred (temporal order) and look at data across different time periods (longitudinal). Being able to explain how society changes over time is important to this discipline as it provides evidence of whatever claim is made. This discipline focuses on actions both of individuals and groups. This characteristic is also very Marxist in nature because it looks at the individual who helps form a group. Lastly, The main focus of historical sociology is change within society. A historical sociologist is responsible for mapping patterns of change.

The foundation of historical sociology is focused on understanding how societies have formed throughout history and what patterns they follow. Historical sociologists study topics that center on **politics and their power dynamics.** Marx's obsession with unequal distribution of power raised some very important questions that require more than just a historical narrative. These historical questions can only be answered through first understanding what is taking place in society and why. This is why historical sociologists describe societal patterns in order to aid in their explanation of historical change. One perfect example of a historical sociology narrative comes from Theda Skocpol who discusses what societal patterns lead to revolutions, an important example of historical change with motivations of societal issues.

Theda Skocpol is a female sociologist and political scientist who has written many books ranging in social topics. The four characteristics that Skocpol uses to explain historical sociology as a discipline come from her book and are **1.** asking questions about social phenomenon that go against what we know **2.** longitudinal studies and temporal order matter **3.** actions and structures are what matter and **4.** focus patterns of change (Greene and Troup, 1999, p.3127).

In her 1997 book titled, **States & Social Revolutions**, Skocpol mentions that **revolutions are socio-historical** in that it takes great societal issues to arouse a revolution (Green and Troup, 1999, 3471). Skocpol begins with a hypothesis before she even begins the historical analysis. She does this because as she is focusing on agrarian bureaucracies, it is important to understand what societal issues are taking place between classes in order to explain why a revolution begins in the fist place.

In conclusion, both history and sociology are disciplines that have established their place in the academic world separately, not collectively. With that being said, the combination of these two disciplines in the mid twentieth century has truly been revolutionary to the field of history in particular. Historical Sociologists are able to explain historical change based on societal issues. Karl Marx can be seen as one major influencer in this field as he stressed the power dynamics in society that lead to change. Theda Skocpol also stresses the power dynamics in society as she looks at revolutions and societal problems that cause them. These two individuals are discussed in this essay because they help us see why Historical Sociology is important and how it is used. Through them, we are able to see the importance of exploring other disciplines when writing history.
