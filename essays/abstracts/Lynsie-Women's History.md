### Women's History
For our textbook, I would like to focus on not only the addition and emphasis of women to the historical narrative, but also the female historians who helped inspire and impact this change. I think in texts this is largely glossed over and underwhelming, especially in Popkin. I would want to focus on more than **just** second-wave feminism but a broader view of female historians, women in history, and their importance to shaping historiography and our world.
