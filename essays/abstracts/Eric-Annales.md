For my section of the historiographical text I have chosen to detail the *Annales School*. I will illustrate the groundbreaking innovations and new concepts that the Annales School brought to historical study. Some of the main contributions form the Annales I will be discussing include the concept of *histoire totale* or Total History. This theory asserts the notion that all aspects of society are a part of a larger historical reality. The Annales School also introduces the practice of quantitative history, using computers to categorize and count vast quantities of statistical data to analyze and derive historical insight from. The Annales also contributed the ide of *mentalites* which explored the attitudes of common citizens in societies to give a broader picture of the historical context to how these societies operated.
