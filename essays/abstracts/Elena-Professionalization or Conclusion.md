When brainstorming the topic for an essay (when the assignment is open-ended), I usually start with two or three possible plans before settling on one idea. As of now, I either want to write on the professionalization of history or write a conclusion essay for the textbook. If I decide to write about professionalization, I will discuss Leopold Ranke’s contributions and methods towards establishing history as an academic discipline in its own right. I will also discuss how, up until the nineteenth century, history was treated as a subcategory of philosophy and literature. If I choose the latter option, I could provide a summary and big picture assessment of what my classmates have written about while tying it in with Michael’s proposed introduction and overview essay.
