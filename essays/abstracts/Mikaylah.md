### Historical Sociology
I would like to be responsible for writing the chapter on historical sociology because I believe my understanding of both of these disciplines will be beneficial to the narration of the chapter. Historical sociology both explains and describes social phenomenon through a power lens. I am most interested in this topic because I study both disciplines and enjoy bringing them both together. When reading Theda Skockpol's exerpt on social revolutions, I found her socio-historical argument to make sense of how both disciplines work within one another. Although I enjoy many aspects of these narratives working together, I realize they do not always work together well. For example, some argue that sociology does not incorporate a narrative the way history does. In this chapter on historical-sociology I plan on explaining both sides of the discourse on historical-sociology by addressing the following themes: structure vs. agency, the growth of modernity, societal change, rationality, social action, and revolutions.
