Marxism is an important because it’s important to understand government, society, and modes of thinking. The purpose of this paper is to identify the origins of Marxism and Communism. I will identify a few countries in the 20th Century that were successful in adopting Communism. The question I’m asking is, “What were the social, economic, and political factors that contributed to its success?”

I will break down the essay into several sections in an attempt to answer these questions. First, I will mention the origins of Marxism. In this section, I’ll provide a biography of Karl Marx and his theories of Marxism. I’ll read the _Communist Manifesto_ which will provide deeper context on the subject. Next, I’ll explain how Marx’s ideas influenced many countries, including the Soviet Union during the Russian Revolution. Most importantly, I’ll conclude by explaining how Marxism contributes to the historiographical narrative including authors’ influences, language, and a little bit of nationalism.
