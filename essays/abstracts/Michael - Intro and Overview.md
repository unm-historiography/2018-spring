## Introduction and Overview of Importance

I hope to introduce the historiographical compliation our class will produce. My introduction will cover not only the breakdown of what is to be included, but also the reasons for their inclusion.
As a common theme throughout the semester, I will speak to the role of bias in history, its inherent political nature, and the necessity for transparent historiography to be incorporated in primary education.
While there are reasons for uniform (even "patriotic") history, the more one is aware of intent, the better they can be in digesting and accurately assessing sources and works.
This section will not cover methods, periods, or peoples in depth, but rather concepts and themes from the course as a whole. It will pull from the inputs and ideas of all the class's contributors and will set the framework for the rest of the compilation.
