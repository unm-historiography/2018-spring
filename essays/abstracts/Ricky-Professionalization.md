The historiographical topic I am most interested in writing about is the professionalization of history, notably including Leopold Ranke and possibly contrasting with the Annales school. Personally, I want to write about this period as the turn of the 19th/20th centuries is one of my favorite periods in history. I’d like to research Ranke’s contributions to historiography as an academic subject. In addition to Ranke, I'd like to go back and find other contributors to the "scientification" of history and their effects on the discipline. Not sure if I should include the Annales (only the first generation of Annales historians) or not. They contrast almost perfectly with Ranke's methods, but can be explored as a subject in their own right. I will have to see if anyone has interest in the Annales School by itself.
