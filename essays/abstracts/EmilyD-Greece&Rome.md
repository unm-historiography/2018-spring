### Emily Delcoure

For my portion of the historiography final, I would like to cover Greek and/or Roman historiography. I am open to do either, or both combined because they are both essential to understanding the transformational process that history has experienced since Greek and Roman times. I don't want to the scope of my writing to only the historians we covered in class, I hope to expand it to include works from writers we don't hear from that often. It will certainly include Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristotle, Polybius, Livy, Tacitus, Plutarch, and many others whose works we had to gloss over in discussion will be included--as well as their contribution to the evolution of history in its entirety. I will use Popkin's work in conjunction with the sources that Popkin referenced to write my section.
