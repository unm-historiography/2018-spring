# “History Wars”: Mythistory, Popular History and Scholarly History

For my historiographical topic, I would like to examine the concept of mythistory and the role of popular history and academic history. I would like to understand how “historical myths” have been impacted by objective academic history. **While McNeil believed that good historians sought objectivity over myths, the academic historian Lowenthal stated that “better a misinformed enjoyment of history than none, a lighthearted dalliance with the past than a wholesale rejection of it”** (McNeil, p. 1) (Popkin, p. 155). Organizations like Disney have played a major role in presenting past for the purposes of popularity and economic gain while scholarly historians have attacked popular history for not presenting a well-researched and accurate account of the past. How is the debate between popular and scholarly impacted by politicians? Should historians “present what actually happened in the past” as Margaret Thatcher stated? (Popkin, p. 156) **Should scholarly history be insusceptible from popular culture?** How does popular and academic history intertwine? What are the ramifications of the popularization of history?
