**Antiquity Historiography**

I have taken many classes that cover Antiquity and also kept in contact with a very knowledgable professor in this field of historical study who I feel that he might be able to help me expand our Antiquity section from what was provided in *From Herodotus to H-Net* and our class discussions. This section would cover both Greek and Roman historiography, unless it is decided that the two be in seperate sections. I would talk about the work done by Herodotus, Thucydides, and Aristole. While possibly expanding the section to include some more discussion on ancient Chinese/Jewish/Christianity historiography as they were only shortly glanced over in FHTH. Although, I feel that Christianity might better be discussed in the Medieval section since Medieval history is deeply engraved with Christianity. The section will also include any points/themes that the class feels needs to be addressed.
