# Why History Matters or The Importance of History

I would like to write about why history matters and why we should care about events that happen hundreds of years ago. I would write about sites of memory both as an individual and as a nation, mythistory and the politics of artifacts and how it changes or distorts our view of history. I would also like to talk about how our own personal or family histories and stories change how we interpret or study history. Maybe use some of the Munslow readings to talk about how important narrative is to history. Or, I would also be interested in writing the conclusion of the book by summarizing everyone's essays and why people should care about the ways history is written and studied.
