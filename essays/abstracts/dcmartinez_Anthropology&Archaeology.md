##### Historial Topic Pick: Anthropology & Archaeology
Desiree' Martinez

I would be interested in researching and contributing to the Archaeology portion of our historiography project. Archaeology has aided in the understanding human culture and has contributed significantly to microhistories as well as quantitative. Thus, anthropological methods have transitioned  the way we construct and understand history and the historical approach associated with it. Therefore, I will attempt to give a timeline and demonstrate the transitions associated with historical methodologies.
