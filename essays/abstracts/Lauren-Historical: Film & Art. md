### Understanding history through film and other media

I would like to write on the topic of incorporating alternative forms of research and knowledge into the field of history. In particular, the value and critiques of **film, song, artwork**, interactive museums and showcases to bring **“history to life”** as it were. We discussed this a little bit towards the beginning of the semester (I believe in one of Popkins’s chapters), but I feel like it could be elaborated on much more and plays a very important role in how average people who are not historians think about and relate to history. 

This would be my first choice. I am also willing to discuss more on Postmodernism, specifically its value and the critiques against it considering its influence on history.
