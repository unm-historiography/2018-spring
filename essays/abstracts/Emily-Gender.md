## Gender Studies through Historiography 
While I do love Marxism, the most interesting historiographical shift that we studied was that of gender. *Houses* has a great chapter on the paradigm shift in historiography surrounding not only the study of gender, but also other marginalized groups that pushed to the forefront. Simply, while it is incredibly useful, it also leaves out a multitude of new and different approaches to looking at gender, and I would like to help close that gap. While looking at gender, I would like to take a two-pronged approach, looking at the study of women in history, as well as the changing concepts of what masculinity and femininity, to examine the shift in historiography during the postmodern period.
