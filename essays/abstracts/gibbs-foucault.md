For my 1500 word essay, I propose to write about Foucault's impact on historiography.

Punishment, then, will tend to become the most hidden part of
the penal process. This has several consequences: it leaves the
domain of more or less everyday perception and enters that of
abstract consciousness; its effectiveness is seen as resulting from its
inevitability, not from its visible intensity; it is the certainty of being
punished and not the horrifying spectacle of public punishment that
must discourage crime; the exemplary mechanics of punishment
changes its mechanisms. As a result, justice no longer takes public
responsibility for the violence that is bound up with its practice.
If it too strikes, if it too kills, it is not as a glorification of its strength,
but as an element of itself that it is obliged to tolerate, that it finds
difficult to account for. The apportioning of blame is redistributed:
in punishment-as-spectacle a confused horror spread from the
scaffold; it enveloped both executioner and condemned; and, although
it was always ready to invert the shame inflicted on the
victim into pity or glory, it often turned the legal violence of the
executioner into shame. Now the scandal and the light are to be
distributed differently; it is the conviction itself that marks the
offender with the unequivocally negative sign: the publicity has
shifted to the trial, and to the sentence; the execution itself is like an
additional shame that justice is ashamed to impose on the condemned
man; so it keeps its distance from the act, tending always to
entrust it to others, under the seal of secrecy. It is ugly to be punishable,
but there is no glory in punishing. Hence that double system
of protection that justice has set up between itself and the punishment
it imposes. Those who carry out the penalty tend to
become an autonomous sector; justice is relieved of responsibility
for it by a bureaucratic concealment of the penalty itself.
