# Medieval Middle East

For the historiography textbook, I want to explore Eastern sources of historiography. I am planning on exploring outside of our textbooks as they are very Western centered. I want to focus on the medieval period as that is my favorite period in history and include various Eastern sources in this narrative. I can only think of the Middle Eastern historians that I know of, like Ibn al-Athir who wrote *The Total History* which was a 13th century "complete" historiographical piece that starts with the *Islamic creation of Adam* to al-Athir's contemporary times. As a chronicler of Salah ad-Din, he does have a bias, as most historiographical authors do. I believe this will provide a unique perspective to historiography.
