### Greek and Roman Historiography
1. "The development of history has looked different to historians, depending on the concerns of their own day" (FHTH p. 25). This concept is significant it argues that _history is subjective_. If the analysis of historical writing changes based on the period it is analyzed in, then the significance of history and historiography is forever changing and evolving.
2. Roman historians such as Livy, focused solely on the city's foundation and rose to greatness and considered the birth of the Rome as the beginning of time. This became an issue for Roman historians as there was no concise history of the city's creation and separating truth from legend. They also created the genre of **national history** (FHTH, 31, 32; Roman Foundations, 49)
3. While historians are concerned with telling the stories of the past and uniquely devoted to discovering the truth, many authors, most notably Herodotus, included their moral judgments or included cultural myths thus potentially diluting the truth (FHTH, 27, 29; Roman Foundations, 57, 66)
4.  Herodotus and Thucydides both used history to create a realistic way of describing past events _as a way to understand the world in a broader sense_ (FHTH p. 26). The combination of accurately recounting past events **and** its significance to better understand our world is still a critical purpose of historical writing today.
5.  Both Herodotus and Thucydides had unique definitions of the nature of history and how to record it (FHTH p 27-28). Herodotus was much more liberal as to what he included in his historical works making his works more of a narrative, compared to Thuycides who believed history should only stick to the facts. (FHTH p 30) _These two methods of historical writing are still present today._
6. History is a narrative. While there is a special connection between empirical truth and history, it is also **open to interpretation**. For example, Thucydides and Herodotus both wrote on Athen's wars with other city-states, each coming to different conclusions about the same war (FHTH, 28, 31)
7. Memoirs, both political and in general are always biased. However, they provide invaluable information on events they participated in and their insights which historians _cannot and should not ignore_ (FHTH, 33).  
8. Greek and Roman historians were not the only civilizations to record their histories. Both Jewish and Chinese societies also had historians that had been recording significant events in their nations (FHTH, 27,35-37). Each civilization had unique attitudes towards their history and which aspects of human life to record (FHTH, 35).
