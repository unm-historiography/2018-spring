# Summary: Greek and Roman Historiography
  - It wasn't until about the ninetenth century that historians began to look at historiography as a field of study on to itself. Historiography was focused on the achievemnts of the West and didn't much dicuss other forms of world history until more recently. (pg. 25-26)
  - Herodotus and Thucydides are often given a privledged seat by historiographers as the original role models for historical writing and tradition since much of their work has remained intact over the years. They were not the first to write of history and acknowledge this in their own works. The Egyptians, Persians, Jewsish scholars, Chinese philosphers all had their own methods for recording historical data long before and during the days of Herodotus and Thucydides. (pg 26-27)
  - Herodotus and Thucydides defined how history should be seen as a story that reflected events of great magnitude which had affected societies as a whole not just the individuals involved. Unlike mythology, the two men were less concerned with the stories of the Greek Gods to explain events of the past. The idea of the gods may have influenced human actions, but they couldn't be proven as directly responisible. (pg 27)
  - Both men propsed that their works were true to the events of the past yet contained "entertaining anecdotes" or "reconstructed speeches". Despite the faults of their writings, Herodotus and Thucydides influenced furure historians on writing styles, considerations for historical narrative, and interpretaions on what include or exclude for those narratives (pg. 30)
  - Roman historians were influenced by the writings of the Greeks, particulary Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius (FHTH pg. 31) (Roman Foundations pg. 48)
  - Often difficult to find works of history from Roman writers and scholars that did not mix "myths" with "facts" as the foundations of Roman culture are steeped in legend or were often written centuries after the actual events.
  - Livy focused on the great deeds and moral implications of Roman history. Like Herodotus, Livy attempted to convey the Roman history in a truthful manner, however his work was often littered with fallacies, chronological errors, and his own biases for political thought from his current era. (Roman Foundations pg. 56-57)
  - Tacitus wrote in a more "depressing" manner; his works follwed the decline of Rome, its hypocracy within government, and the broader questions of human roles within the pattern of civilization. (RF pg 60-63)
  - Ammianus took a different approach, instead of focusing on the "origins" he sought to chronical the event in which he lived. "The task of history is to deal with prominent events, not to delve into trivial mintutiae" (pg. 64).
