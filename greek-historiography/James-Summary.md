•	While the study of historiography did not gain popularity until the end of the 19th century, the study of history existed in various ancient civilizations and empires. Greek historians such as Herodotus and Thucydides, dating back to 5th century B.C.E, were some of the first influential ancient historians. (Popkin, P. 25-26). 

•	An historian’s work is impacted by the context of the time period they live in. In the 20th century in the midst of numerous scientific advancements, “the history of history was written as a story of progress,” (Popkin, P. 25). Tacitus wrote his historical works in the context of a declining Roman Empire in the 2nd century (Faces of History, P. 61). His works were designed to encourage Romans to pursue the early Roman ideals of republicanism and liberty. 

•	Roman historians were focused on the empire’s origins to help develop their national identity. (Popkin, P. 32) (Faces of History, P.49). By analyzing the reasons for Rome’s “extraordinary success,” Roman historians were better equipped to handle the national challenges of their current time period (Popkin, P. 32).  

•	The Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides were significant to the study of historiography because they were the first well-documented historians to develop a “method of telling a story of the past,” (Popkin, P. 27). Instead of examining history through only facts and chronology, these pioneers wrote history through thematically based stories. 

•	Roman historians’ understanding of how to study history was influenced by the Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides (Faces of History, P. 55). This is significant because the origins of western historical studies can be traced in a linear and chronological manner from those famous Greek historians. 

•	Throughout Roman history, historians sought truth and clarity about Rome’s past (Faces of History, P. 63). However, Roman historians did not exercise the same “objectivity” in their work as modern historians because the work of Roman historians was created for the primary purpose of promoting the well-being of Rome. (Faces of History, P. 65). 

•	Prestigious Greek and Roman historians did not engage in the study of history to ascertain how important events impacted individuals but how they impacted nations, and the rest of the world (Popkin, P.27) (Faces of History, P. 60). Herodotus and Thucydides studied what was in their view “the most important conflict the world had ever known,” (Popkin, P. 27). The Roman Historian Florus saw the study of Roman history as “not only of a single people, but of the human race,” (Faces of History, P. 60)

•	The study and circulation of Greek and Roman history was divided among class lines. Greek and Roman history was written for the “limited audience” of society’s elites (Popkin, P. 34). The Roman Historian Livy was fascinated by the impact of Rome’s elites, property owners, prestigious soldiers, and politicians on Rome’s national history (Faces of History, P. 58).
