What is the "proper" way of doing history? I found myself focused on this phrasing used by Popkin throughout my reading. In this section I believe he attempts to show that there are various ways to "doing" history but yet I feel the use of the term "proper" frustrating. Like Popkin, I do not believe that history should be understood through one approach but viewed through multiple lenses. Yet, the problem I have is why indicate that there is a "proper" way of doing history at all? Therefore, I can't help but feel that some Eurocentric ideaologies like the word "proper" still dominate the understanding of history. Furthermore, it could be understood that Popkin at times attempts to steer his readers from this rhetoric but yet, is he still drawn to the "proper" methods and understanding of historical writing?

Popkin uses the word "proper" twice, first when attempting to show how old methodologies of viewing history have been, "replaced by the 'proper' way of doing history". (p.26) And secondly, when referencing Roman writer Quintilian and his "proper way of composing history." (p. 34) Popkin illustrates that there are different modes to understanding history by using juxtaposition examples of Greek historians, Herodotus and Thucydides. He uses the overlapping timeline of their lives as a base for their truth telling. Therefore, Popkin can demostrate that though they have different approaches to their narrative, Herodotus through mythology and Thucydides through firsthand accounts, both writers are regarded with historical reference to events of that time. Thus, when is history being done "properly?" Furthermore, who determines the "proper" way of doing history? Is it possible that Popkins rhetoric subscribes to 19th century Eurocentric ideals while trying to fit in with 20th century perspective of inclusion?   

In contrast, writer Donald Kelley's,  _Roman Foundations_, does not focus on "the proper way of doing history" but shows how history can go through different stages of progression. And therefore, does "proper" mean progression of these ideologies. Roman foundations originate with pagan methodologies and stories of tyrant rule. As the city-state develops individuals explore agency which gives way to political philosophy and thus, truths. These philosophies become the foundation for which Romans relate their rhetoric. And therefore, without rhetoric, history would just be chronicles of the past with geographical context.(p.66)  Thus, there is no way of "doing proper" historical writing but that the methodologies themselves are "proper" to our own individual history.
