### Chapter 2- Greek Writing Comment
Jerome T. Mondragon

Many Greek historians including Herodotus have been criticized by modern historians by incorporating mythology into their historical works. The Greek writer Lucian of Samosata argues that in order to create good history, the historain has to be "incorruptable...impartial... and independant" rather than "being swept down by poetry's wild enthusiasm." (Popkin 34) However, it's impossible to seperate religion from history. Religion is an important to teach the origins, morals, and values of a civilization. 

Religion taught the origins of a civilization which was already being used by the Egyptians, the Persians, and Hebrews. (Popkin 26-27) The Romans were especially religious and were referenced in their historical writings. Titua Livus explained the origins of Rome by writing stories of their founder Romulus. (Roman Foundations 57-58) It was during this turbulent time when laws were established to create a civil Roman society ("Foundations" 50) Myth was a means to promote noble leaders. Ammianus wrote about leaders who had the "favour of a beneficent providence." ("Foundations"64) Julius Ceaser's recongnized the importance of image and bolstered his conquests in Europe to mythic status. ("Foundations 53) It was their mythic quatilties that people idolized and emulated them. Religion also served as a warning for current governments. Rome was in a state of "moral decay" which was blamed on foreign religions. The European and Judeo religions were especially targeted which resulted in their persecution for magic and treason. ("Foundations" 61-62) Rome regailed over the olden days and beckoned its return to its mythic and herioc origins (Popkin 27).

The most important reason why religion was incorporated in history was because written history useful to the literate higher classes. (Popkin 35) History had to be relatable and understood by the people. It was also difficult because much of histories were lost or unknown (57) Therefore, it was necessary to include religion and the gods to explain these mysteries. Historians can't seperate religion from history and thertherfore can't be unbiased. Religion is necessary to explain civilization and needs to be incorporated by historians today.
