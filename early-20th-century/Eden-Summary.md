## Summary 
* The period of 1880-1960 was a period of trial and error for professional history, because it barely became a legitimate course of study in the late 19th century. This led to an increasing number of historians who came under criticism on the significance of their work (Popkin, p. 98). 


* Both World War I and II increased this criticism. It forced historians to conform to antidemocratic ideologies in their works and *simultaneously* disrupted their careers. (Popkin, p. 99) 

* World War I was useful for historians from all combatant countries, who used this time to endorse the war and become more patriotic through books and articles, which enforced a specific narrative (Popkin, p. 105). 

* Post-World War I challenges included history being objective. Most historians wrote history with a bias to support causes *they believed in personally*. Popkin gives the example of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the utilization of Marxist principles in history being used to "combat 'bourgeois' critics" (Popkin, p. 109). 

* By the end of the first world war, an "Annales" schools developed in France. It was a scholarly movement founded by Marc Bloch and Lucein Fabvre, who wanted to be liberated from the "nationalist framework" that had plagued historical writing (Popkin, p. 111).

* These *Annales* scholars also encouraged historians to *utilize different sources* for their history and to stray from the Rankean tradition of history from the elites and written records. They used past historical records and physical artifacts to show how the poor and illiterate lived. (Popkin, p. 112). 

* World War II led to an increase in interest in history in the allied countries, and an increase in historical truth *in defense of freedom*. It also increased the prestige of all sciences, including the "social sciences," from psychology to sociology and history. The specialists in these fields were called to explain the societies involved and plan postwar reconstruction (Popkin, p. 114).
