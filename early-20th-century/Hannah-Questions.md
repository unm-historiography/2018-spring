## Questions for Historiography in the Early 20th Century

- Popkin writes that "governments throughout the world saw **scientific historical scholarship as crucial for the development of national identity and cohesion"**(p.97). It it possible to write about national history without contributing or supporting the government narrative, and how can historians defend their work from being used negatively? By both individuals and countries.

- Friedrich Nietzsche's three forms of history **monumental, antiquarian, and critical** and his descriptions of each show both the positive and negative ways each can be used to view history (p.99). What do you think is the form being used the most today and how does that inform our view of the world? Which one is used most in **popular history and academic history**?

- American historian James Harvey Robinson, argues that *"students needed to learn not obscure fact but rather the processes that that had created the world"*(p.105). Do you agree with Robinson that the process it more important for a historian to learn or do facts play a vital role in history? **Can history be true without focusing on facts?**

- E.H. Carr wrote that readers of history should first **"study the historian before you study the facts"**(p.122). Do you agree with Carr, and do you research the author before you read a historical book or article? Does it take away form the conclusions or argument if the historian has some **bias**, if the reader is aware of it?
