**History in the Early 20th Century**

•	“In 1884, the four hundred colleges and universities in the United States employed only twenty full-time history professors” (p. 97). After the passage of the GI Bill in 1944, universities across the country were hiring history professors at a rapid rate (p. 114). Instead of an elite social class being the primary consumer of history, the GI Bill led towards a far greater and more economically diverse college enrollment. The popularity of the history ballooned in the early 20th century. 

•	Popkin explains that Friedrich Nietzsche was the first influential historian of the 20th century. Nietzsche promoted an understanding of history through three fields: monumental, antiquarian and critical history. In contrast to Ranke, Nietzsche had a negative opinion of completely factual and “abstruse academic research” (p. 99). In Nietzsche’s view, believed that historians could give society the past “we would prefer to be descended, as opposed to the past from which we actually descended.” 

•	Nietzsche’s philosophy of studying history established justification and a clear framework that countries would use to **promote nationalism in the 20th century** (p.99). In the 20th century, Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States and many other countries sought to greatly influence the study of history within their own countries. Prior to Hitler’s downfall after World War II, the Germany’s government developed and promoted nationalist historians (p. 100). The Soviet Union supported Marxists historians while the United States sought to encourage “progressive values” (p. 109-110). 

•	While 20th century historians grew in number and popularity, various factions and viewpoints formed on the study of history. In the United States, historians debated how to assess the historical treatment of African Americans. D.W. Griffith introduced his racist work “The Birth of a Nation” with much admiration from President Wilson (p. 105). African American historians offered rebuttals with works such as *Journal of Negro History* by Carter Woodson (p. 108). 

•	In the aftermath of World War I, **the enlighten view of history was “shattered”** (P. 106). Mainstream historians no longer saw the history of humanity as a story of progress and improvement. Some historians such as Oswald Spengler even saw the unsatisfactory outcome of the war as evidence of the decline of western civilization. 

•	Even though various 20th century historians challenged Ranke’s view of “objective history,” George Orwell completed his works “in defense of historical truths” (p. 113). While countries such as Germany and the Soviet Union distorted truth and manipulated history to bolster their regimes through “propaganda,” Orwell’s fictional novels gave his readers insights into the corruption, intrusion and tyranny of totalitarian governments. 

•	In order to provide a “total history” of humanity, the Annales School of historians focused on **social and economic history** in addition to political history (p. 110). This “scholarly movement” developed in France fought not to promote a singular ideological viewpoint such as Marxism, fascism or nationalism but to provide a detailed and accurate account of history. One of the Annales School’s most influential historians, Fernard Braudel combined history “with economics, demography and geography” to give his readers a cohesive understanding of the world (p. 118). 

•	In the early 20th century, history became “a respectable place in public life” (P. 124). While history did not have the same “prestige” as the “hard social sciences,” historians were starting to gain admiration from the academic community. In 1945, The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. won the Pulitzer Prize for his work on President Andrew Jackson. African American historians became intellectual leaders in the civil rights movement by playing a role in the consequential Supreme Court Case Brown v. Board of Education and combating Jim Crow Laws (p. 115).
