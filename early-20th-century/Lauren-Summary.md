### Summary: FHTH Scientific History in an Era of Conflict

- According to Popkin, Leopold von Ranke had secured a place of importance for the study of history throughout the world. Standardization in universities writing and studying history had taken hold based on the Rankean model. Historians could be considered "professional" and had better access to sources of research thanks to archives of history that their predecessors lacked. Governments had begun to fully support historical scholarship seeking ways to secure national identity and standardize education in schools. **(Popkin pg. 97)**

- The discipline was not perfect though and critics began to question the value of history and the Rankean model itself for its emphasis on political science and lack of interest in the general public, women, and minorities. **(pg. 98)**

- **Friedrich Nietzsche** warned against the "excessive obsession with knowledge" argued that there were "three forms of history", **Monumental history, antiquarian history, and critical history**. Although each of the three forms had value, they could also become dangerous for societies. Monumental history could de-value the achievements of the present day, antiquarian history could lead to an obsession with old models and a refusal to change, and finally critical history could be constructed to rewrite history to reflect a "new past" that better fit a person's or nation's idea of themselves. A refusal to learn from the past. **(pg 99)**

- Ranke's notion of having "every era be judged on its own terms" was coitized. How could the past truly be seen objectively? The **"idealist" model of history** based on the writings of **Wilhelm Dilthey** put emphasis on the historians themselves. History did not exist except through an historian's recreation of it. It was subjective. **(pg 100-101)**

- On the opposite end, philosopher, **Wilhelm Windelband**, wanted history to be considered a science again. History although never be as precise, could be seen to reflect the same fields as chemistry, physics, astronomy, and geology and taking influence from these each of fields. Similarly, **J.B. Bury** insisted “history is a science, no less and no more.” While historians may not be able to fully understand and reconstruct the past scientifically now, future generation would. **(pg 101-102).

- Philosophical debates in the early 20th century over the nature of history continued. Other historians, philosophers, and sociologists like **G. W. Trevelyan, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and Emile Durkheim** argued that viewing history as a science took away society's role in interpreting history and left out the non-academic public who had fallen in love with "history". **(pg 102-103)**

- Despite the debates, academic scholars of history were usually not the ones that had caused the general public to value history. Non-academic authors like **Elizabeth O’Neill** and the invention of film brought history to life for young reader and audiences who looked forward to seeing actors bring historical figures to life. **(pg 104-105)**. 

- Film in particular could be criticized for their nature to skew historical events and often portray the lives of non-white characters as meaningless. African-American authors, historians, and scholars directly protested these biased interpretations of history. **(pg. 105, 108)**
- The World I had a significant impact on historians. Patriotism for one's own country affected historical writing with a theme of "us versus them". Later devastation of human life on an unprecedented scale shattered the previous views of human progress and historians again questioned the value of their works and study. Was human reason flawed? **(pg. 105, 106)**
 - World War II instead had some historians conforming to the values of oppressive governments, re-writing history to conform to national standards. The United States became a safe haven for Jewish scholars fleeing Nazi Germany began to write of the horrors of the holocaust in an effort to make sure history was not forgotten. **(pg 110).**

9: great, except no mention of the Annales school, which was a continued theme throughout the chapter and a hugely important historiographyical development. You focused a bit more on the popularization of history, which you've covered very well.
