## Early Twentieth Century Historiography – Questions

1. Historians who subscribe to the Rankeian school of thought, see the inherent connection between history as a science and political infrastructures. Those who followed him and split from this limited view – for example, Karl Marx (Popkin pp. 89-91) – chose to focus on the social dynamics of populations (particularly minorities) and their role in history (Popkin p. 98). Both approaches address the link between history and the “_development of a sense of national identity and cohesion_” (Popkin p. 97).
**Is there a purpose to the “science” of history, other than identity politics?**

2. Nietzsche’s fascinating distinction between types of history facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of historiography and its uses, aims, and goals (Popkin p. 99).
**Of Nietzsche’s three distinct forms of history – _monumental, antiquarian, and critical_ – is there one type that stand out as more helpful, hurtful, or popularized today?**

3. Italian historian and philosopher Benedetto Croce argued that “_the past really had no existence outside the minds of those who studied it to answer questions relevant to their own times... the fact that history takes place in the present_” (Popkin p. 101).
**Is this an accurate interpretation of history? Does this stand on the opposite side of the spectrum, opposing Ranke’s methodical opinions of what historiography should be?**

4. **Evaluate** Charles Peirce and William James’ claim that _truth should be defined in terms of what was useful, rather than measured by an absolute standard_ (Popkin p. 104).

5. The adage “_history is written by the victors_” is supported by events such as the “war guilt clause” of the Versailles peace treaty (Popkin p. 107), which proclaimed Germany to be the sole bearer of responsibility for the Great War. Despite this, Germany – the “loser” in the conflict – achieved great success in writing their _own_ history, creating flawed perceptions of reality and ultimately contributing to the Second World War.
**Why do some “losers” succeed in maintaining a narrative, while others are drowned out by the history of the “winner”?**

6. The fall of Germany’s place as the leader in historiography occurred as a result of its racist and distorted Nazi-era perspective, rather than it losing World War II (Popkin p. 113).
**While the United States maintains its primacy as a world hegemon today, has the shift away from Western-centric history caused a decline in American historiographical credibility?**

7. **What can be said of Orwell’s allusion that freedom and democracy are inexorably linked to freedom and democracy** (Popkin p. 113)?

9: very nice. some questions (4, 7) are too vague, esp compared to your others. Provide some context (besides the citation) and make a start to answer the question given what we've read so far.
