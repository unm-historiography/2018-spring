## Scientific History in an Era of Conflict Summary 

- The new **"scientific"** method of studying history lead to a **preservation of materials, the expansion of the study of history, and a new sense of value in the public eye**. History could now be used as a political tool to establish a sense of nationality through government sponsorship, especially when it became regulary taught in schools _(p.97)_.
- Nietzsche argued that there are three forms of history: monumental antiquarian, and critical. **Monumental** history celebrates **"great deeds and epochs of the past."** It can be used to inspire people by demonstrating what has happened in the past, _but can also make the present seem "insignificant" in comparison_. **Antiquarian** history, in moderation, **connects people with their past and gives a sense of identity**, _but can lead to the rejection of natural change_ (such as the refusal to modernize as the rest of the world adjust to developing technology). **Critical history passes judgement on the past**, but if it gets too critical and people try to seperate themselves from the past as a result, they also deny the events that shape their culture and modern identity _(p. 99)_.
- Benedetto Croce argued that "**the past really had no existence outside the minds of those who studied it**," instead believing that history takes place in the present. Historical study following this **idealist** thinking should then be used to guide the decisions made in the governing of nations in a positive manner _(p. 101)_.
- As literacy grew, the consumption of history became more popular. **Public-oriented history** was **_not_** as rigorously tried and tested as academic history, and as such, it focused instead on **"popular history,"** which was presented through works written by women authors and "moving pictures" as well as by university scholars _(p. 104-5)_.
- The study of history changed along with the rest of the world along with Wordl War I. Nations relatively new to the study of history tried to **"legitimize"** themselves and their existence through the production of their own **national histories**, while **"victorious" nations' histories became less nationalistic** in responce to the intense nationalist propaganda of the war. Most historians shifted their focus from the production of more optimistic histories observing the greatness of the past to writing histories that were **_uncertain_ of whether they could actually prove historical "fact"** _(p. 105-7)_.
- After the First World War, black historians challenged the idea of an **objective _and_ unified history** of the US. Histories of African American contributions to important US history were produced, but were not necessarily integrated into popular teaching until after the ending of Segregation in the mid-20th Century _(p. 108)_.
- Between the two World Wars, historians became disillusioned and stopped believing in **objective history**. Instead, they thought **history identified with one side of conflict or another**, and middle ground could noit be reached. Because of this, history should be written to identify with a **_cause_** in mind, like Communism in Soviet Russia. These histories made **no** real **effort to be truthful**, but rather painted the **cause** of the historian in a beneficial light _(p. 109)_.
- **Annalistic** history reinvigorated the popularity of studying history by asserting that **all areas of human existence were worthy of study**, and providing a **less structured way to study history** than **scientific** history had. Annalistic history suggested that written documents were not the only viable sources to learn history from, but **physical objects, language itself, and customs were also potential sources** that could provide facts about history, and that the lives of the not-elite were also valuable to study _(p. 112)_.
- Post-war European scholars also started focusing on how things like **geography** affected history, and began observing and producing **social** and **economic** histories that **observed a connection between historical research and developing social justice**- as history was researched, changes in societal rules began to adjust the balance between priviledged and non priviledged groups _(p. 118-119)_. **Postcolonial** histories then further challenged nationalist history and societal rules by introducing **oral tradition** as **valid historical evidence** and using it to challenge previously accepted history. 
- By 1960, History was a widely accepted academic discipline that was understood to be **a subject that could address and answer questions about humanity** _(p. 123-4)_. This qualification matches with current modern standards of what makes a science a "science"- it's a method of study subject to intense scrutiny that answers a question about the world.

10: i think highlighting phrases rather than individual words might make this easier to skim. otherwise excellent summary points.
