For the reading this week I found Popkin's section on Friedrich Nietzsche to be the most compelling. "Those who tried to seperate themselves compeletly from the past, 'taking a knife to its roots," denied the extent to which all human beings are shaped by their previous history." (p. 99) *Are we completely shaped by our history?* Does the need/desire for understanding the past force us to fulfill these models which enables us to distinguish or establish our own "living history"? (p.101) 

Popkin states that Nietzsche proposed 3 models for his view on history. First, "**Monumental history**," which focused on great deeds of the past that were used to inspire what "man" was capable of but warns could make the present seem insignificant.(p.99) Second, "**Antiquarian**," which provided a sense of identity but also warned that it could lead to a rejection of development.(p.99) And lastly, "**Critical history**," which required analysis and disapproval of history which could inspire movements about injustices.(p.99) Therefore, this semester we have learned how history has been understood, studied, and evolved but do we unknowingly follow models like Nietzche? *Does this rhetoric follow every nation-states ideology to aid in its history?*

It could be understood without recognition that even in the 21st century these models are still being introduced in academia regardless of the various models and methodologies introduced by Popkin. In American elementary schools we are immediately introduced to "monumental" histories. Stories of our "Forefathers" establishibng our country and its morals and values. Thus, as children we are taught to identify as "American" with "American" ideologies. Once we enter high school "Antiquarian" histories are introduced. Thereby, as Nietzsche proposes, we understand the greatness man once achieved and compare our current position in the world to its past. Thus, rhetoric like, "if the Romans/Greeks could..." is highly used and sets up a position of development to either recess progression or in our case, advanace it beyond our predecessors. And lastly, it is in college that we are finally asked to be "Critical." Within this setting we are finally allowed to question and disect history. However, for those who are unable to attend college is it too late? Are these histories purposely introduced at impressionable ages were national history is not a question but truth?

Therefore, I ask, when is it too early to introduce various methodologies into academia? Do we target certain histories first in order to justify current politics and economies? It is important for every person to understand the basics to the past, its linear and historical value. But if we introduce this methodology from a young age and enforce this thinking, are we (American academia) grooming nationalism?
