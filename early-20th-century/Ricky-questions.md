# Scientific History in an Era of Conflict

## Questions

- German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche catalogs three distinct forms of history (Popkin p. 99). Do you think Nietzsche is leaving out a type of history that could be a more substantial category? Of the three, which would you say was the most dangerous of his time? Which one would you say is the most dangerous today?

- According to English historian R.G. Collingwood, historians can only establish knowledge of the past by reenacting what happened through their own view (p. 101). Considering our talk last class about objectivity, do you believe that this is the case and a major problem in historical work, or is Collingwood’s statement unfounded?

- The various accounts of the origins of World War I brought great concern that many of the historical methods created in the 19th century could not determine what was *right* (p. 107). Considering our many interpretations of history with today’s methods, would you say they are ineffective due to their **indecisiveness**, or is consensus impossible?

- The Annalist movement of interwar France urged historians to look at other useful sources for historical information, such as artifacts and language (p. 112). New sources of historical information are being invented at a rapid pace. In the future, do you think that social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram will be used in the professional academic historical setting? Or will it be seen in a similar vein to movies and entertainment media?

- Do you think that oral history can be trusted to conduct historical work? Historian Jan Vansina believes that oral histories “are not just a source about the past, but a historiology of the past, an account of how people interpreted it” (p. 121). When saying oral history is an interpretation of the past, could one say the same about written history? **How much is trust in these sources a cornerstone of history?**

- In the 20th century Western World, history was often put in a lens of constant development, where we march forward to a better future while letting curel events of the past fade away (p. 120). Did this contribute to the marginalization of African Americans in the United States in the later 20th century? Can you think of anything else that falls under this idea?

8: I like where you're going with these, but these questions generally veer too far into speculation or very broad opinion questions that we're not really prepared to answer yet. The easy fix is to more explicitly tie them into the present and past readings to suggest how we should approach answering the questions given what we've read so far.
