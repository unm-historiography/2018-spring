## Scientific History in an Era of Conflict Summary 

- The new "scientific" method of studying history lead to a preservation of materials, the expansion of the study of history, and a new sense of value in the public eye. History could now be used as a political tool to establish a sense of nationality through government sponsorship, especially when it became regulary taught in schools. (p.97)
- Nietzsche argued that there are three forms of history: monumental antiquarian, and critical. Monumental history celebrates "great deeds and epochs of the past." It can be used to inspire people by demonstrating what has happened in the past, but can also make the present seem "insignificant" in comparison. Antiquarian history in moderation connects people with their past and gives a sense of identity, but can lead to the rejection of natural change (such as the refusal to modernize as the rest of the world adjust to developing technology). Critical history _passes judgement on the past_, but if it gets too critical and people try to seperate themselves from the past as critical history presents it, they also deny the events that shape their culture and modern identity. (p. 99)
- Benedetto Croce argued that "the past really had no existenceoutside the minds of those who studied it," instead believing that history takes place in the present. Historical study following this **idealist** thinking should then be used to guide the decisions made in the governing of nations in a positive manner. (p. 101)
