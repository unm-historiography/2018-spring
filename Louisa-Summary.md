From Herodotus to H-Net
Throughout the Middle Ages, the Chinese remained strict on recording their past with the hope that it would guide the future when the time comes. They believed in the importance of understanding and learning from the past. Western Europe and Judaism historical writings had grown to incorporate the events of the past that help to reflect upon Christian teachings and beliefs; most historical writers of this time were churchmen. Many Middle Ages authors were influenced by their religious beliefs which led to many writings with moral and religious lessons embedded within them. While in Britain, Bede had approached history from the view point of a single "national group" (40) and how their past played into their faith. The Islamic world remained focused on collecting and writing down different aspects surrounding their prophet, Muhammad (quotes, translations, etc.). Although, Ibn Khaldun would be produce great critiques of historical writings. The Crusades, then, paved the way for heroic writings that portrayed the heroism in the fighting that took place, as well as, "lachrymose history" which "emphasizes the suffering of a minority group" (43). This form of writing become extremely important in modern day with the Holocaust and its history. 

History in Medieval Mirror
"This conflation of opposites, of sacred and profane history set in a context of classical and Christian values, reflected the structure and substance of medieval views of the recent and the remote past" (99). Historical writing had, again, become intertwined with religion. It had also become a means for those a part of the history to become immortal through writing. Myths became popular in poetry and pedigrees as writers tried to connect their figures/nation to past figures. 4 important writers came out of the period: Jordanes, Gregory, Bede, and Paul the Deacon. All remained influenced by their personal religious beliefs and had wrote their part of history in accordance with their faith. National Traditions writing highlighted a single group of people and portrayed their view of the past from their perspective on it, much like Bede had done in his writings. History wasn't so much a narrative but writings that centered life and it's events around God and his plan for mankind. History in the Medieval time period was influenced by religion which had become connected with how historical writings were shaped, written, and with what result.
