* Munslow writes about how there is still tendency” among historians “to be less clear on concepts like authorship, story, expression, voice, [focalization] and, most importantly, the nature of narrative itself” (p. 2). If historical writing is narrative writing, why were issues concerning “the nature of narrative itself” not discussed by scholars until the postmodern age? Could it have something to do with the “fresh [conceptualization] and [theorization]” of history in the later twentieth century (p. 2)?

* Chapter 1 was all about how historical narratives follow structures similar to fictional narratives. Does this mean that aspiring historians should have a background in or at least some knowledge of creative writing to write better historical narratives? Should Munslow’s models be enough of a guide?

* Munslow states that “history is not a replication of that which is past and gone” (p. 29). Historical narratives are judged by their representation of a subject, aesthetical choices, “emplotment,” “ethical/ideological choice,” etc. (p. 43). How does the analysis of a historical narrative compare to the scrutiny given to fictional depictions of historical topics (plays, film, television, etc.)?
