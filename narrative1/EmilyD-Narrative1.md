# Narrative and Vocabulary?

1. It seems to be an opinion of Munslow that in order to fully understand and appreciate history in its brevity, there is a level of vocabulary that **needs** to be understood. Can students of historiography grasp the concepts of history without using terms like "emplotment," "mimesis," "correspondence," or "diegesis?" (Munslow, 14/32/36/21) Are there less pretentious ways to communicate ideas?
2. Does *the* story of history exist? How does Munslow approach this question on page 4 *versus* page 29? Is either a complete answer, or does he leave room for debate?
3. In general, is deconstuctionist theory the best way to go? Personally, this is not the way I would choose to learn history, but its not the worst way we have approached it so far in this class. Is there a "**best practice**" when it comes to history, how would Munslow answer this question?
