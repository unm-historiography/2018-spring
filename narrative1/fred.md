## My three items of interest

If the linguistic turn and correspondence theory got into a fight at a bar, who would win?

Should we ascribe historical agency to narrative as we might to technological artifacts?

Munslow is lame for splitting hairs about constructionists, reconstructionists and deconstructionists. Aren't there as many historical methods as there are historians? What do these categories really get us in terms of analyzing historiography? How much worse will my scholarship be if I don't fit into these labels?
