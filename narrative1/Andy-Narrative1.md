## **_Narrative and History_**

### *Alun Munslow*

**_Questions_**

1. According to Alun Munslow, the logic of **_narrative representation_** is gained through consideration of three primary epistemological approaches known as **_reconstructionism,_** **_constructionism,_** and **_deconstructionism._**
In what way does *deconstructionism* challenge the two former approaches? Why are epistemological decisions important to historians and historiographers?

2. Meaning ultimately derives from the relationship between the content of the past, the historian as an author, and the choice in **_mode of expression._** How is this organization critical in creating a discipline of the-past-as-history? How have the narrative elements of content: story, narrating, narration, and expression, become a mechanism for exploring the logic of history?

3. What constitutes the concept of **_followability?_** How is **_troping,_** or how we ascribe meaning to events in terms of similarity and difference, link to the concept of *followability?*
