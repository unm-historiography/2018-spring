### Narrative and History:Intro-Ch.2
- Alan Munslow discusses theory of mind explained as epistemology and its relation to history and the past. History is related to the past through narrative.
- In chapter one, Munslow discusses the difference between history and the past. He mentions that these two categories cannot be translated together even by empiricism (p.28). Are references good enough to use as historical evidence?
- Is the history narrative meant to be liberaing (p.24)?
- Every historian is an author who is speaking to an audience. Does the historian have a duty to explain both the story of the past and the historical meaning (content/story)?
