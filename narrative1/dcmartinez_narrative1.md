##### Topics of Interest:

- What is history? 
-- a "coherent reality" of the past, which is then rendered with analytical **objectivity** as a historical narrative that **conveys** the most **likely truth** of the past (p. 2)

- Narrative Turn:
-- _Order of Priority_ (doesn't this still follow a method/structure?)
-- 1. Reference, 2. Explanation, 3. Meaning, 4. does the narrative tell us what we 'need to know about doing history?"  (p.3)

- Turns (challeging epistemology/reconstructing what we already know):
-- Linguistic
-- Aesthetic 
(p. 8)
- Justified Belief/Narrative Turn:
-- history is **constructed thru the lense** of the historian based on their **interest**. Therefore we 'learn' history based on their construction. (p.17)
-- This plays an important part in understanding and reconstructing the past thus, can have a **fictious approach**. 
-- ? Do historians of this approach envoke their own **agency** or their subject of interest? Or is this how historians develop their 'signature' narrative? (p.33)
-- "The greatest irony is the reconstructionist belief that 'the past' **imposes** itself on 'history.'" (p.17)
