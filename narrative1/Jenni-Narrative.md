## Narrative and History

1.) I like that the introduction is **_very specific_** in outlining what the author is defining **history** as immediately, unlike some of the authors of the books and articles we have read. I appreciate that the author is direct that he will be treating history specifically as a "**narrative history**," and uses phrases like "**most likely truth**." This acknowledges that **the author knows there is bias in what he will be discussing**. This saves us, as readers, time by not forcing us to try to distinguish what things he expresses are biased, and **allows us to better consider and discuss his ideas** rather than try to figure out **what** they actually are _(p.1)_.

2.) I like the idea that **history is a result of narrative-making as much as it is about the events that happened** _(p.4)_. It's a lovely, simple way to express that **history is subjective**, and that **historians, as the ones that shape how history is preserved, have as much (if not more power) over how history occurs than the historical figures that shape and commit the events**. For example, if a leader wages a war and fails, the only way people will know that they had a war three hundred years later is if the event was recorded. If they find the battle sight, but have no reccord of why soldiers and warriors died en masse at that location, then it's just a field of artifacts. If a historian references it, however, we not only have an explanation of why there is a field of dead, but we will know who they are, and most likely, why they are there.

3.) The description of history as "**fictive**" leaves me with mixed feelings. While I agree, **the only way to try to recover history 
is by creating a narrative about it**, I'm not sure that it inherently makes it "fiction." In my personal opinion, _if there is a devotion to as much corroborative evidence as possible, the narrative of history lies in a middle ground between absolute truth and pure fiction_. This grey area is the best we can hope for, since history is so subjective (as established earlier), but "fictive" is too dissmissing of a term. (p.29).
