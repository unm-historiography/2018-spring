As of 9 am, I have not finished the reading. I should be done by 1, but I just haven't been able to do enough to a proper post within the time limits set for these posts.

1.) I like that the introduction is **very specific in the outline of what the author is defining history as**, right off the bat. I appreciate the upfront honesty that the author will be treating history specifically as a "**narrative history**," and uses phrases like "**most likely truth**," because this acknowledges that **the author knows there is bias in what he will be discussing**. This saves us, as readers, time by not forcing us to try to distinguish what the author's bias is and what was biased from before he repeated his facts, and **allows us to better consider and discuss his ideas** rather than try to figure out **what** they are.
