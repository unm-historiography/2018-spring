# Narrative and history

1. The distinction between "the past" and "history" in the introduction really opened my eyes to the way the words we choose shape the reality of history (p. 9). The idea of narrating in history seems like a necessary evil to historians; it has to be "interesting" and it has to draw people in. 

2. In chapter one, Munslow explains the "explanatory structure of history" is *story, narrating, narrative plus an expression* (p. 25). This model is expressed on page 26 which means that narrative history has the same "three fundamental elements as fictional narrative" which include *narrating, story and narrative*. This was really fascinating to me because the idea of narration within history was something we have touched on, but not really focused on. It is amazing that something "nonfictional" has to follow the same structures as "fictional" writing, because of the need for an interesting narrative within our historical writing. 

3. Chapter two discusses history as a story. There is no universal method to write "the-past-as-history". Yet there has to be an element of "followability" (p. 31). This means that history has to be a story, as opposed to a chronicle which lists events.
