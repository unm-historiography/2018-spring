- Jenkins asserted that history cannot be presented in either a subjective or objective manner, but rather that any historical narrative comes from an authors *positioned* framework that is guided by their intrinsic biases such as theories, attitudes, values, and ideologies (p.4). This is interesting because it causes the reader to have to analyze and contextualize the author/narrator and their intent as much as they scrutinize the source material/evidence being presented. 
- I find it interesting that although historians goal in their narratives differ than those in fictitious fields, there is still an importance to be said for narrative **performance**. The language and style of a narrative has a great deal of how receptive and far reaching an audience will be. This gives those who are adept in harnessing this skill in narrative a distict advantage over their counterparts who are not.
- The distinction Munslow makes between **past** and **history** is one that I find interesting. He describes how history only comes to be throught the advent of the historians construction. Everything the author writes has to be contextualized into a **story space** that the reader accepts under the assumptions that it is an accurate representation of the past (p.18). This emphasizes the faith we place in a narrators information and how much validity we assume of the author's position.
