**Narratives and History**
*"It is because history is a species of narrative that it is useful to examine how it is created and how it relates to the claims usually made that history explains and offers meaningful interpretations about the past"* (Munslow, p.1). While the idea of a narrative history is one that we have touched upon, it was never one that we had a full class discussion on. It's going to be very interesting to see how Munslow will further argue for the need/importance of narrative in history.

It was interesting to read how *'fiction'* and *'nonfiction'* works are fundamentally not very different. They both incorporate the three key elements: the narrative, the story/content, and the narrating. But what makes them different is, *"Consequently, in history, he says, the narrative is supposed to begin with the story of the 'real events', while in fiction there is only the pretense that it starts with the 'real story'"* (Munslow, p. 23). I had never thought of the two "genres" being more similar than different. 

Munslow's idea of *"story space"* was very interesting as it made sense to the making of a narrative. I think he's arugments and evidence were well used and spiked a level of intrigue in me for the weeks to come. It was kind of hard leaving past discussions/readings out while I was reading Munslow, as none of them were ever truly focused on the idea of a narrative history.
