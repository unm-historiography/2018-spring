## Thoughts About Narrative and History

1. I really liked the way Munslow emphasized important words and used drawings to explain the different concepts he wrote about.

2. I found it very interesting to think about the difference between the past and history and how we often use these words in the same way. I don't think that I fully agree but Munslow's view but it an idea I will think about more. His seven assumptions about history were also very interesting and I wonder, **what are the differences between a historical fact and a historical narrative?** (p.30) Munslow seems to believe that there some sources that can be fully trusted.

3. Is Munslow's view of "the past as history" an approach that historians should adopt? Do we use **the past** and **history** in the same way as a society?
