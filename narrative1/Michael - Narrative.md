### Just Some Thoughts, Yo.

1) Dr. Gibbs introduced this book as a short walk-in-the park compared to our other readings.
Though I certainly agree it's not Kelley's "Faces of History", it's certainly not the enjoyable historiography of Popkin.
I suspect our bearded professor has a soft spot for this text because of its strategic (and effective) use of bolding throughout.

2) Why is the author so sure that history is different than the past, and that there can be no translation between the two by means of empiricism?
Is this an echo of the common claim that there is no fact, but rather only perception in the current timeframe of the historian?

3) Marwick has some interesting perspectives on 'the postmodern fantasty' and 'the facts'.
Does he place _too_ much emphasis on primary sources? Can't they _too_ be manipulated for an agenda?
