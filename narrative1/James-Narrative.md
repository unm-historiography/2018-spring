# Building a Narrative

1.	William Gallie questioned if “the story of the past actually existed to be found” (P. 3). Do you believe that historians can provide an accurate and true account of the past? Do you believe that we should adopt the “the past-as-history” approach? (p. 8)

2.	Gerald Genette stated “there never has been a pure fiction or non-fiction” (p. 23). If that is true, how can historians organize their narratives in the least subjective manner? (p. 24)

3.	Do you believe that the process of gathering information and telling a narrative is a scientific process? (p. 39)
