- It is considered that the Renaissance or as Popkin infers "the early modern era" began in 1450 as a "rebirth of learning" after the Dark Ages. Great social and cultural changes occured that saw the Church challenged by new ideas like Luther's Reformation and Machiavelli's The Prince. (p. 47)

- History took on a new connotation as "science" based which was propelled by thinkers like Lorenzo Valla who championed research, source reference, and encouraged questioning. Though Valla's research focused on language he aided scholars in using new methodolgies about reconstructing the past based on material evidence left behind versus solely relying on written accounts. Furthermore, the revival of Latin sparked new interest in historical works like Herodotus which only aided in _Humanism_ particularly, politics. (p. 49)

- While secular writing and authority dominated Medieval history, Renaissance writers like Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini challenged and questioned political authority. Both writers witnessed Italy's power either dominated by single familes or threatened by outside forces like France. This  furthered revived interest in understanding antiquarian writers like Livy who wrote on the fall of his own political system. (p. 50) 

- National histories adopted a new framework by disregarding myths and by embracing their own autonomy. The discovery of America and its Native inhabitants forced a new narrative in understanding the world beyond the Bible and antiquity. Thus, works like Bartolomé de las Casas's _History of the Indies_ attempted to reconcile this new land into the universal history. (p. 51)

- As the Church's authority continued to be questioned it was Martin Luther who caused the most resistance. His _Ninety-Five Theses_ called out the corruption of the church and used various works to justify his arguements. This only further divided Europeans and their idea of history. However, the compiling of this data formed a new way of viewing history in the form of periodization which categorized the past into distinctive blocks of time. This changed the way historians chose to view the past and thus affected the way they wrote. (p. 53)

- Inventions like the printing press allowed the circulation of works to reach the masses and encouraged knowledge for the wealthy and impoverish. However, this only provoked rulers to establish forms of censorship but nonetheless, established "instant history." (p. 54)

- Another structure of writing developed in this time in the form of the diary which gave partial and subjective view to the things writers witnessed and described. However, it was plays that truly brought history to life especially from English writer William Shakespeare who often wrote about English and antiquarian histories. (p. 55)

- Enlightenment thinkers now focused their framework on the future and what accomplishments it could bring. However, strong ties to culture and identity stimulated nationalist ideals in people like Johann Gottfried von Herder. He suggested that all nation's past were considered on their own terms. Thus, events like the French Revolution only progressed this rhetoric in writings. (p. 65)
