Throughout time periods, the study of history has consistently been used by powerful elites as a tool to achieve their political aims and bolster their political clout. Starting in the early modern period, elites recognized that controlling the lenses that their societies viewed history could be an effective medium to spread propaganda, and defame their political and religious opponents. Published in 1439-1440, the historical work "Discourse on the Forgery of Constantine" by the Italian scholar Lorenzo Valla claimed the document supposedly written by Emperor Constantine that gave the Pope dominion over Rome in the 4th century was a fabrication (p. 48). Valla completed his historical works to weaken the authority of the Catholic Church. In the midst of the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century, Protestant historians published the Magdeburg Centuries to discredit the Catholic Church by exposing its corruption to the public. By controlling people’s knowledge of the past, elites gained further influence and power in their present time period. 

The growing popularity of the printing press, theater, and widespread historical works gave societal elites new mediums to spread their views (p. 54). Politicians and kings could use plays like "Julius Caesar" to show their citizens the danger of anarchy and coup d'etat (p. 55). In seventeenth century France, Cardinal Bossuet published the "Universal History" to promote the ideology “of the absolute power of the French king, Louis XIV” (p. 57). By filtering historical data to fit their desired narrative, allies of monarchies were able to use the period’s new technologies to prop up their regimes. Conservative early modern political leaders were not the only ones that attempted to reshape history, enlightenment philosophers wrote history as a story of progress and improvement (p. 60). Historians were unable to separate “scholarly and popular history” in this period because the study of history was deeply political (p. 67). While Popkin says that the “institutions that make scholarly history possible” were not developed in the early modern time period, the study of history is still inherently political because it promotes political ideologies.

Over the past 50 years, many historians have shifted their focus to minorities, women and societal groups that have been often left out of general historical studies. This historiography trend has correlated with the rise of political movements such as multi-culturalism, inclusion and equality. In this circumstance, historians regularly use history to promote a political agenda. In recent years, conservative elites have used popular history to implore Americans to recognize the successes of its past. Conservative leaders will often use the popular history of President Reagan to appeal to Americans that they should “Make America Great Again.” Using history as a device to promote a political viewpoint is still deeply woven into the fabric of modern society.
