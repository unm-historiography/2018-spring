  The study of history is used by powerful elites as a tool to achieve their political aims and bolster their political clout. Starting in the early modern period, elites recognized that controlling the lenses that their societies viewed history could be an effective medium to spread propaganda, and defame their political and religious opponents. Published in 1439-1440, the document Discourse on the Forgery of Constantine by the Italian scholar Lorenzo Valla claimed the document supposedly written by Emperor Constantine that gave the Pope the domain of Rome in the 4th century was a fabrication (p. 48). Villa completed his historical works to weaken the authority of the Catholic Church. In the midst of the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century, Protestant historians published the Magdeburg Centuries to discredit the Catholic Church by exposing its corruption to the public. The study of history was used as a mechanism for current leaders to impact their present time by clarifying the past. 	

  The growing popularity of the printing press, theater, and widespread historical works gave societal elites new mediums to spread their views (p. 54). Politicians and kings could use plays like “Julius Caesar” to show their citizens the danger of anarchy and coup d'etat (p. 55). In seventeenth century France, Cardinal Bossuet published the Universal History to promote the ideology “of the absolute power of the French king, Louis XIV” (p. 57). By filtering historical data to fit their desired narrative, allies of monarchies were able to use the period’s new technologies to prop up their regimes. Conservative early modern political leaders were not the only ones to attempt to reshape history, enlighten philosophers wrote history as a story of progress and improvement (p. 60).  Historians were unable to separate “scholarly and popular history” in this period because the study of history was deeply political (p. 67). While Popkin says that the “institutions that make scholarly history possible” were not developed in the early modern time period, the study of history is still inherently political and used to promote political ideologies.

  Over the past 50 years, many historians have shifted their focus to the writing about minorities, women and societal groups that history has often left out. This historiography trend has correlated with the rise of political movements such as multi-culturalism, inclusion and equality. In this circumstance, historians use history to promote a political agenda. In recent years, conservative elites have used popular history to implore Americans to recognize the successes of its past. Conservative leaders will often use the popular history of President Reagan to appeal to Americans to “Make America Great Again.” Using history as a device to promote a political viewpoint is still deeply woven into the fabric of American society.
