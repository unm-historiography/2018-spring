1.	Renaissance historians went through great lengths to begin a period of revisionism in order to from a more accurate idea of the past. Should a historian’s rhetoric be focused on the revision of ideas? Can redefining how we see the past be considered revision if it contradicts the public’s perception of history even if the empirical facts remain the same?

2.	History is shown to be highly influential to national identity by Machiavelli and Vico. *Does the current divide between a purely academic understanding of history and the public’s basic understanding of the past lead to a fractured national identity?* Are we unable to bridge the gap in our shared historical contexts? Have we left behind the public in the mad attempt to find truth in the overabundance of information swarming them in daily life? 

3.	Can history transcend the targeted national identity power politics into a global sphere? In other words can history ever reach a point where it is written in globally unifying message, **attempting** to fulfil the humanist approach like Valla?  (P.48-49)

4.	What can we examine about the divide in pro-protestant and pro-catholic? What trends about the period can be brought into contextualization of the public/scholarship divide now? 

5.	Can we export important historical skills of thorough scrutiny of sources and critical analyses into the public domain in an effective manner? Are these skills perhaps more important than ever in such an oversaturated information market?
