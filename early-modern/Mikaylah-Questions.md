### The Early Modern Era
1. Popkin mentions that, beginning in the 18th century, history began to be seen as a science **(p.48)**. Do we continue to see history as a science today? Did we ever really see history as a science?
2. It is mentioned that the Chinese Dynasties began looking at history through centuries **(p.53)**. Is it beneficial to look at history through these century-long periods? Why or why not?
3. How do we know that what we learn about the past is true?
4. Should we rely solely on remnants of the past to construct a historical narrative about that past **(p.49)**? If not, what else should we add into the mix?
5. Beginning in the 15th century, many European historians began to learn that different people have different histories **(p.51-52)**. How has this realization impacted modern history?
6. The historian, Alexandre Oexmelin, is mentioned **(p.57)** with regards to how his historical work influenced many things, including the famous film *Pirates of the Caribbean*. Popkins mentions that Oexmelin's influence on less "serious" historical writing is beneficial to history. How true is this? Do movies like *Pirates of the Caribbean* contribute to the viewers historical knowledge?
7. Jean Mabillion mentions that all "historical research can be discredited by fears" **(p.58)**. As historians in training, how does this affect our understanding of secondary sources? Is it a healthy practice to always be skeptical of historical writings?
8. Should history be practiced as a form of literature, infused with drama and moral **(p.61)**?
9. To what extent should religion be involved in historical narratives?
10. According to Chinese historian, Sima Qian, history is not meant to teach moral lessons, but instead to find the truth within historical narratives **(p.66)**. How important are moral lessons to history?

8: You do well with providing page numbers, but give a little more textual detail as to what prompts your question. (#10 is a good example). Also, remember to make a start in answering your own question based on what we've read so far. Be careful of super broad questions like #3 that don't make a specific connection to the reading (i.e. you could ask that question every week!), or questions like #5 that ask to examine historiography that we haven't really studied yet.
