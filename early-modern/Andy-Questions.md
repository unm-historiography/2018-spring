**Chapter 3**: The Historiographical Revolution of the Early Modern Era

**Questions**

1. In the initial shift of learn and understanding from the Medieval Period to the Renaissance, what were the main objectives of scholars?(p. 49) In the search for truth, is it always necessary to question long-established traditions and way of thinking? Will the careful scrutiny and comparison of past and present sources get us closer to the truth?

2. According to Popkin, **Renaissance Humanism**, or the system of thought that attached importance of knowledge to humans rather than to divine or supernatural matters, became the dominate framework of writing and interpreting historical information during the Early Modern Era.(p.49) How did Italian historians such as, **Niccolo Machiavelli** and **Francesco Guicciardini** incorporate humanistic ideals into their writings and how did they radically break from the framework of medieval history writing?(p.50)

3. In what ways did Renaissance intellectuals differentiate between the objectives, methods, and interpretations of historians of the past (ancient Greece and Rome) and contemporaries of the present? Why is this differentiation and distinction important to scholars? How can a revival and renewal of interest in **antiquity**, also create a rejection and differentiation of scholars in the past?

4. How did the **Protestant Reformation** divide Europeans in a social and educational context?(p. 52-53) How did this religious upheaval affect history, as well as, other aspects of social life?

5. The *printing press*, created in 1460 by Johannes Gutenberg, changed the way in which texts circulated and expanded access of historical access to the masses.(p. 53) How did this access to historical information, as well as, current events, create a more humanistic framework of knowledge? What were some of the major new mediums created in the Early Modern Era?(p. 55) How did these new forms of representation of historical, pseudo-historical, and current events reflect **Humanism** during this period?

6. The critical methods of historical writing and the rejection of authority for the bible foreshadowed the major intellectual movement of the 18th century called **The Enlightenment**. How did The Enlightenment create a *quarrel of the ancients and the moderns?* (p. 60) Was antiquity the pinnacle of human achievement, or can modern authors of the Early Modern Era, or even today, be as equally masterful?
