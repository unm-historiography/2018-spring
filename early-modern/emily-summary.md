1. The Renaissance was the birth of a new way of looking at history. One of the major changes during this period was historians view of religion. Instead of creating history to fit the story of Christianity, historians tried to separate religion and history. While many historians were still very devout Christians, the history that they wrote did not focus on one larger path that society was supposed to follow (Popkin pg. 49). 
2. In the period before the Enlightenment, humanism became incredibly influential. Humanism is the close study of society and culture, emphasizing human virtues over those of the divine. Historians began to look at history through a humanist lens, and this would lead to a dramatic change in the methodology that historians used to analyze the past (pg. 48). Humanism was also one of the driving factors behind the Enlightenment movement. 
3. While the Enlightenment period is a time of moving away from the clergy and towards secularism, there were still very heavily religious influences. The Protestant Reformation created a huge commotion in the Catholic church, and produced very distinct divides within the historical community (pg. 53). Both sides writing history to confirm their own beliefs. The effects of this divide lasted until the 1900â€™s. 
4. The invention of the printing press changed the world. Now, historians could widely publish their work. The everyday man could now read about the history of ancient Rome or of the British Empire. This also changed the methodology that historians of the time used. Instead of combing through all of the manuscripts they had present at a single monastery, now historians could find wide spread historical documents from all around Europe (pg. 54). This change helped historians get more accurate information, as well as increase public knowledge about history. 
5. During the Enlightenment, people began moving away from the clergy and the divine right of kings, and towards a more humanist approach. Instead of looking at society as part of the last great empire before the rebirth of Christ, some historians began to look at it as a society progressing towards the future. Vico, an Italian historian, saw all societies in a cyclical pattern. Each society began in an age of gods, then an age of heroes, and ending in an age of men. First ruled by faith and the supernatural, then ruled by the elites, and finally ruled by fellow men (pg. 60). 
6. Because of the creation of the printing press, history was able to be circulated more widely (pg. 66). This lead to the ability of a historian to making a living off of their writings, which would lead to history becoming a valid profession and an actual university class. 
7. The chronicles and histories from the Middle Ages are not to be ignored. While they did drift away from the techniques used by ancient Greek and Roman historians, they still had their value. While the methodology of the Middle Ages would be swept aside for the new methodology of the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods, the histories created during that time period still held value (pg. 48).  
8. The methodology of Renaissance and Enlightenment historians would be improved and molded more over time, but the basic principles would stay true to historians during the modern period. The periodical would emerge during this time period, and it would lead to what is now called peer review, one of the most critical methodologies in history today (pg. 55).

9: could use markdown formatting a bit more to highlight key points; honestly having a hard time finding much to criticize.
