Questions: *FHTH*,"The Historiographical Revolution of the Early Modern Era," p. 47-67  
1. Throughout this chapter, Popkin introduces and discusses the works and contributions of various historians, the former of which are often dismissed as outdated in subsequent decades. Should works like Edward Gibbon's *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* (p. 63-64) still be read and studied if not for the purpose of understanding historiography before the twentieth century?

2. A few passages in the chapter are dedicated to the different ways in which history has been divided (p. 48-49, 53, 60-61): by "ages," by centuries, etc. In what instance is one way of division better than another and why? (In other words, in what instance would it be better to divide history by a decade, a century, or several centures?)

3. The historical plays (or simply, the histories) of William Shakespeare have helped to form the popular conscience regarding figures like Marc Antony and Richard III and events like the Battle of Agincourt (p. 55). How much of your own thoughts regarding historical figures and events have been shaped by what you have read in historical fiction novels, heard in songs, or seen on stage, television, or in movies?

4. The invention of the printing press and periodicals had a significant influence on how historical knowledge was recorded and distributed (p. 53-56). How similar/dissimilar of an influence has the internet had on how historical knowledge is recorded and distributed in the twenty-first century?

5. The historiography of the Renaissance held the Ancient World in such a high regard, while the historiography of the Enlightenment welcomed the possibilities of the future. What are some of the positive or negative points behind either way of thinking about human history (the achievements of the past vs. what the future may bring)?

8: aim for a blend reading-focused and general questions. as a set, these tend too much toward the speculative side. #5 has a nice idea behind it, but is too unfocused to facilitate discussion--need a clearer starting point and/or motivation).
