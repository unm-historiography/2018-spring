# Questions

1. What would be a better way that Popkin could explain his inclusion of the quote that says history can be both "individualizing" and "generalizing" (p. 69)?  How do we usually keep the two ideas separate, and how--in the nineteenth century--do they begin to work together?
2. From Popkin's point of view, the revolutions were ***the*** catalyst of the transformation of historiography (p. 70-73). Is that true throughout history? Would it be accurate to say that revolutions are the sole sources of transformational history?
3. What is Popkin's opinion on the changes in historiography during over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? Was it positive or negative? How can you tell?
4. Does philosophy have a place in history? Where would Leopold Ranke stand on that question, and why does it matter to the transformation of historiography?
5. Was there a fundamental change in history to make it more scientific, or is it just the view of the people that studied it that changed?
6. When Gil speaks on Ranke's views and intentions of history, is Gil himself projecting modern historiographical ideologies onto Ranke's views? Or do Ranke's writings depict these ideologies as well?

8: good questions, but say a little more in your questions about why they matter, such as how they highlight a contradiction in the reading. also, for questions like #6, paraphrase the analysis of Gil you're referring to so you're question is more approachable.
