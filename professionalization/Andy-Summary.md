**Summary**

1. The Nineteenth Century would experience a transformation within history into an academic discipline, which created more prestige and greater influence in politics and culture. New historical methods and approaches strayed away from the notion that human beings cannot alter their own history and more towards the notion of human agency and development. Within these new approaches, historians sought to appreciate individual eras of the past within it's own terms, rather than some overall scheme of progress or decline.(Popkin, p. 69)

2. The correlation between history and science, placed historical knowledge in a more secure foundation and began the **professionalization** of it's methods of research.(Popkin, p.70) Specific associations with developed programs of specific academic training were created to establish standards, which often questioned the validity of all other forms of history as acceptable representations of the past.(Popkin,p. 70) 

3. History in the Nineteenth Century was deeply affected and altered by the French and American revolutions, which shifted general thinking of history as narratives from the perspectives of leaders or elites to narratives of the people.(Popkin, p. 70) Profound changes were occuring by the collective actions of ordinary individuals, such as the storming of the Bastille in France.(Popkin,p. 71)

4. Historians and intellectuals had various opinions on how to treat the history of the past and historical methods. Edmund Burks advised intellectuals not to ignore the lessons of history; even the irrational institutions and patterns of conduct handed down from the past, reflected an accumulation of practical experience.(Popkin, p. 72) German philosopher **Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel** expressed that there was a spirit and idea behind reality and history necessary to find what final purpose have sacrifices been offered. (Popkin, p. 73)

5. German historian **Leopold von Ranke,** created notions of many new methods of historical research, including and firmly establishing the importance of use of original documents and the objective reporting of the information they provided.(Popkin, p. 77) He also established the concept and practice of the **research seminar,** which was revolutionary in the fact that now students are not merely listening to lecture, but engaging with sources, interpreting those sources, and creating arguments with the guidance of an instructor.(Popkin, p. 78) Ranke combined pre-existing historical methods, with four main principles of scientific historiography: objectivity of historical truth, the priority of facts over concepts, the uniqueness of all historical events, and the centrality of politics within history.(Gil, p. 384-385)

6. Historical writing within the Nineteenth Century was dominated and essentially controlled by nationalist perspectives. The government funded universities and these universities were the places in which history was taught and where documents were made available. (Popkin, p. 82) This national framework from historical writing proved to be influential on the writing of history in the non-Western world, such as in the Islamic world. (Popkin, p. 85)

7. French philosopher **Auguste Comte** expressed the inevitability of progress through "positivism," or the idea that information is gained through sensory experience, interpreted through reason and logic. (Popkin, p. 87) Some of these "positive" facts, included the scientific assertion that there were fundamental differences in intelligence and character among the different human races and between the sexes. These notions created justifications for European imperial conquests, westward expansion of the United States, and slavery and segregation in the American South. (Popkin, p. 88) Evolutionist ideas of Charles Darwin, as well as, class conflicts and distinctions scrutinized by Karl Marx also perpetuated scientific, human division. (Popkin, p. 88)

8. Cultural development was heightened during this era, with geological and archeological advances, the emphasis of the study of language, which made connections between ancient civilizations, and the development of new historical mediums, such as the the wax museum, photography, and panoramic paintings. (Popkin, p. 92-93) Lastly, the establishment of the American Historical Association expressed the increased professionalization of history and historiography. (Popkin, P. 93)

9. Very thorough summary of important points! Be careful that your bullet points don't get TOO complex. Your biggest ones (5, 7, in particular) should be split up into more quickly digestible bullets. As do many of your others, it's OK if they are related and meant to be read in sequence.
