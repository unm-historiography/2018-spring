## Professionalization of History Discussion Questions


- How valid is Historical Fiction as a way to organize and present History? Does the nature of the genre of fiction- to tell a story that is undoubtedly not true- exclude Historical Fiction _entirely_ from being able to tell a factual historical account?
- Thomas Gil writes that **"the historian should not judge the past"** (p. 384). In theory, this sounds easy, but in practice, is it actually possible to be completely objective about a history that the historian is invested in? (If the historian isn't invested in the history they are writing, why would they even write it?)
- Ranke placed great importance on reporting the history **objectively**, without being critical of historical periods and their accompanying beliefs, and highly favored the use of **original documents** in recording History (Popkin 77). How did this change the way we study and record history now, keeping in mind that original documents decay with age and are far outnumbered by secondary and tertiary sources in the modern era?
- After reading the passage from _From Herodotus to H-Net_ about **Nationalism and Historical Scholarship** do you think there is a way to fix the recording of National Histories without alienating other groups (p. 82-6)? If so, how? And if it is not possible, is writing Universal Histories that include all peoples instead the answer to the problems that the writings of nationally focused history can cause?
