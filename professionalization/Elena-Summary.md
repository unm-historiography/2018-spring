Thomas Gil, “Leopold Ranke,” p. 383-392

* Leopold Ranke is best remembered for applying a scientific approach to the study of history (Gil, p. 383). He believed that historians should strive to “show what actually happened” (Popkin, p. 76). The Rankean method involved reconstructing past events from historical documents (what we would now call primary sources) and critically assessing said sources. This was a great contrast to the work of G.W.F. Hegel, a philosopher who took a more speculative approach to understanding history

* Ranke developed the research seminar while working as a professor at the University of Berlin. Before the development of the seminar, students were taught history solely through lectures. Ranke’s new method allowed for students to both learn a historical narrative and come to their own conclusions on the narrative through engagement with, and critical examination of, sources (Popkin, p. 77-78). 

* While Ranke believed in thinking about history critically, that did not mean that historians should judge the past. He rejected moralizing since that defeated the purpose of the “historian’s objectivity” (Gil, p. 384). Ranke, unlike the historians of the Enlightenment, did not believe that history should be judged according to contemporary principles, nor should it be shaped “into a story with a moral lesson for the present” (Popkin, p. 76).

* Ranke contributed to the creation of history as an academic discipline in its own right. History had previously been just a subcategory of literature and philosophy. Once history became its own discipline, the work of professional historians was judged by a community of other professional historians (as opposed to the public or whoever was the ruler at the time) (Popkin, p. 78-79).

* The French Revolution made major contributions to Western historiography, such as the establishment of a national archive that could be accessed by all, and the idea of a history “from below.” This new way of thinking about history emphasized the contributions of ordinary citizens who united under and achieved a common purpose (in the case of the French Revolution, to overthrow the monarchy) (Popkin, p. 71). 

* The nineteenth century also saw the rise of nationalist histories. Donald Kelley described them as a kind of “mythistory” that “enhanced notions of national identity or antiquity as well as modern superiority.” One of the more infamous cases of such a history was the work of German historian Heinrich von Treitschke (one of Ranke’s students), which combined jingoism with anti-Semitism. His work laid the foundation for German history and policy in the early twentieth century, mainly the country’s involvement in World War I and the Hitler regime (Popkin, p. 82-83).

* Some nineteenth century thinkers sought to make history more like the natural sciences. Such thinking led to the idea that the “inferiority” of women and certain races (i.e. anyone who was not white) was biological in nature, not a social construct (Popkin, p. 86-88, 90-91). Karl Marx’s own “scientific” approach described history and economics as being interconnected. His pro-imperialist stance appealed to Soviet Russia and Communist China, which is ironic considering how Marxism was meant to be “one the side of human freedom” (Popkin, p. 88-90).

* New technologies and innovations, such as photography and museums, made history all the more accessible to non-historians. As for historians, their discipline was expanding thanks to institutions such as the American Historical Association (Popkin, p. 91-94).
