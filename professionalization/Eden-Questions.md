## Questions 
1. Ranke believed history was the best way to understand human nature because the historian has access to the "*contradictory nature of man and practical reality*" (Gil, p. 388). If these are important in understanding human nature, are they **inherently** important to the understanding of history? Does understanding the *nature of man* help with the understanding of history? 

2. Hegel's view of "the cunning of Reason" states that "the worst historical catastrophes had, in the long run, promoted the development of properly regulated human freedom" (Popkin, p. 73).  I understood this as "horrible things have happened in the past so we can have a better future." Why is this a right **or** wrong view of history? 

3. Relating to Vico's cycle of history theory from Tuesday's reading (Popkin, p. 60), in which there are the three cycles of society: 
  *   Stage one is people's belief in supernatural powers, "an age of the gods"
  *   Stage two is where those gods become elites who claimed "supernatural origin" and gain authority.
  *   Stage three is the "age of men and human government" (Popkin, p. 60). Societies would then eventually collapse, with new nations taking their place.

**How** does this relate to the "cunning of reason", as mentioned above? If it is a cycle, how is the development of freedom regulated? 

7: Important questions, but perhaps too narrow considering Popkin's emphasis on a fundamental change in historiography taking place. What questions should be thinking about considering 19th century historiography in general?
