•	Development of the modern historic academic tradition began with efforts to remove cyclical and linear methodologies. *Historians like Meinecke attempted to promote the power of human agency in the advancement of society rather than a cynical view of inevitability.*(P.70)

•	**Like concerns earlier in the class the power of history became manifest in the rise of nationalism.** Works of historians (some unconsciously) prompted the rise of historical glorification in the search for national identity. Revolution and nationalism would emerge in developing European states with regimes relying heavily on the unifying power of identity forged from a shared legacy. (P.72)

•	Nationalization was used in the attempt to give power to any regime. English historians used their power to legitimize the colonialization of India. Abuse of history would aid raise the regimes of the Nazi’s or Napoleon. (P.82.83)

•	In the appearance of enlightenment rationalism, a conflict sprouted between romantic and rational analysis. Historians struggled over histories purpose in its approach to creative culture. *Rationalists would succeed in methodology while the romantics would succeed in extending public interest in the past.* (P.75)
  >This theme Harkins back to our discussions on historical fiction in popular culture.

•	~~Renke~~ Ranke provided a radically new approach in the historical research. His methodology was created in the search for a scientific historical method. The approach was to present the past to public emphasizing states vast influence over the human narrative. His research also gave birth to source interpretation and footnotes as skeleton for the historian’s narrative. (P.78.Gil)

  >**The search for objective knowledge is not the same as a natural science; no natural laws are being created from historical research.**    (P.86)

•	 The scientific approach developed by ~~Renke~~ Ranke brought about the peer review. Historical peer review aided in the legitimization of historic professionalization.(P.80)

•	The professionalization of history allowed for the development of specializations within the field. *Cultural examination from gender to economics of the past aided in the development of other social sciences revolving around the past as a predictor of the present.* Marx arose as prime example examining the social conflict he described as an ever-present struggle between classes. (P. 90)

•	New research methods sparked the rise of skepticism and the reexamination of ancient religious and philosophical texts.  This leads us to furthering our holistic view of humanity through the scrutiny of truths and myths of the past.  (P.93)

6: First, it's RANKE, not RENKE. Repeatedly misspelling the main person we're reading about is not good. Second, these seem very hastily done because so many key concepts are unexplained. For instance: "The scientific approach developed by Renke..." ... So what is the scientific approach--isn't that a key point in the reading today. "... brought about the peer review" ... So, what is peer review and HOW did it aid in the legitimization (and it totally did!). Lastly, I do like your attempt to bring in prior discussion, but be specific--don't just mention that something we read for today relates to something we read before. Make the connection explicit and explain why it's important to mention.
