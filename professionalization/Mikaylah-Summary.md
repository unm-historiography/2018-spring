### The Rise of Academic Scholarship
- The academic discipline of history was transformed in the 19th century as many historians began writing on a larger scale (p.68). The idea of history as a story between nation-states also developed during this time (p.70). 
- **Historicism**: Many 19th century historians focused on **change** and the individuality of each era (p.69).
- The revolutionary era brought about an extreme focus on nation-states and the revolutionaries developed a national archive (p.71).**Edmund Burke** placed an importance on knowing the history of one's own nation-state (p.72).
- Philosophy becomes very important to history during this time period due to it's realization that change occurs over time (p74).
- Things such as **architecture** and **photography** developed historical significance during the 19th century due to their ability to freeze history in some sense (p.75,93).
- Leopold von Ranke strongly disagreed with the incorporation of fiction and philosophy in historiographical studies due to their insight into moral. He believed it best to stricly find out the facts (p.76-77).
- Ranke is responsible for starting the **seminar** (p.78).
-Leopold von Ranke:
  1. Recognized as **founder of modern scientific histpriography** (Thomas Gil, 383).
  2. Brought the **scientifuc method into the discipline of history** (Gil, 383).
  3. Believed in a **divine association in relation to world history** (Gil, 388).
  4. Focused on the **uniqeness of each era** (Gil, 391).
