### The Rise of Academic Scholarship
- The academic discipline of history is transformed in the 19th century as many historians begin writing on a larger scale (p.68). The idea of history as a story between nation-states also develops during this time (p.70). Nation-state narratives become important as historians shift from writing about nations and their elite to writing about **nations and their people**.  
- **Historicism**: Many 19th century historians focus on **change** and the individuality of each era (p.69).
- The revolutionary era brought about an extreme focus on nation-states and the revolutionaries develop a national archive (p.71).**Edmund Burke** places an importance on knowing the history of one's own nation-state (p.72).
- Philosophy becomes very important to history during this time period due to it's realization that change occurs over time (p74).
- Things such as **architecture** and **photography** develop historical significance during the 19th century due to their ability to freeze history in some sense (p.75,93).
- Leopold von Ranke, during this time period, strongly disagrees with the incorporation of fiction and philosophy in historiographical studies due to their insight into moral. He believes it best to stricly find out the facts (p.76-77). However, he sees a deeper meaning behind history himself (Thomas Gil, 389).
-Leopold von Ranke:
  1. Is responsible for starting the **seminar** (p.78).
  2. Recognized as **founder of modern scientific histpriography** (Gil, 383).
  3. Brought the **scientifuc method into the discipline of history** (Gil, 383).
  4. Believes in a **divine association in relation to world history** (Gil, 388).
  5. Focuses on the **uniqeness of each era** (Gil, 391).
  6. Focuses on **original documents**, made **facts a priority**, believed in the **centrality of politics within history**, and believes **each era is unique in it's historical phenomena** (Gil, 384).

7: excellent condensation of Ranke's contributions. other bullet points are **too compressed**; that is, they don't explain terms or important ideas very well ("larger scale", "focus on change", "philosophy becomes very important", etc). Also, explain the significance of your bullet more as well (for instance: why was a focus on nation-states important?)
