1.  Popkin states that Herodotus and Thucydides lived roughly around the same time that the historical books of the Jewish Bible were written, yet each account of their histories are contrastly different. (p. 36) Nonetheless, the political state of these societies were entangled in war or the aftermath of wars. Therefore, do extreme tribulations spark a "national myth" (p. 37) thus history?

2.  Popkin proclaims that the purpose of the Medieval history writer, "was to present the truth that would **convince** their readers of appropriate moral and religious lessons" (p. 39) and Kelley infers, "medieval authors did have a recognizable idea of history, though it had to do more to do with rhetoric." (p. 100) Therefore, does a strong rhetoric control the masses? Can this rhetoric ignite reform or furthermore, can lack of rhetoric ignite disintegration? 

3.  Does national history navigate historical thinking? Popkin expresses that medieval historians, "often tried to connect their countrymen to this universal past by claiming that they were descended either from offspring of the Biblical Noah or from figures from antiquity" (p. 40) and Kelley states, "There has been much discussion about the loss of historical memory in the Middle Ages, and indeed there was a resurgence of myth not only in poetry but also in the efforts of historians to establish legitimacy through ancient pedigrees, biblical and classical." (p. 103) Therefore, does this framework shape historical memory which perpetuates ethnocentrism as discussed in class? 

4.  Popkin and Kelley both state that _chronicles_ and _annals_ were used to record events as they happened. Popkin says that these chronicles, "had few literary qualities and made no attempt to explain the causes of the events they described" but further goes on to state, "that chronicles often reflected the influence of local rulers." (p. 41) And Kelley states that there are "different modes of perception" when distinguishing between chronicles like clerical and aristocratic which could feature moral or political judgement." (p. 119) Therefore, can any dictation be free of bias? And how much have chroniclers influenced historical memory?
