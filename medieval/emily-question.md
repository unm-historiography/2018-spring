### *FHTH* 35-45 and *Faces of History* 99-124
1. Did the decline in education, and the disappearing knowledge of Greek and Latin, throughout the early medieval world lead to a decline in the quality of the history produced (Popkin p. 39)? Or did it simply lead to a smaller volume of history being produced? 
2. In the middle ages, most histories were written in monasteries. Because of this, a lot of histories were built upon a religious framework, with the biases of the locality implicitly incorporated (Popkin p. 36). Does this decrease the worth of the histories that were produced during this time, or does its value lie within the moral themes of the society that can be interpreted? 
3. Bede was the first historian to measure time from the “Incarnation”, giving way to the terms BC and AD (Kelley p. 120). Before this, different societies measured time according to their own history, making it difficult to communicate across time and empires. Does this Judeo-Christian centric view of time harm or help our perception of history? Why didn’t this standardization occur before? 
4. Do you think that the different ways that history developed throughout the world is telling of the religious, cultural, and social values of each society?
