## FHTH & History in the Medieval Mirror Summary 

- Medieval historians had to confront the issue of combining their own historical work with past works of other societies. However, losing knowledge of the Greek language in Western Europe created a large hurdle (Popkin p. 37-38). However, some linked their own historical works to other regions, including “barbarian people” (Popkin p. 40). This was progress over Greek and Roman history in terms of inclusion to other civilizations and shows that not *all* of the Medieval period was a step back in historiographical methods.

- While Greco-Roman history rarely concerned itself with the future, historians under Christendom were closely tied with the bible, and the inevitable end of times (Popkin p. 36). This aspect was held in firm regard for more than a millennium and represented the shift and domination of Christianity in Medieval Europe (Medieval Mirror p. 99). This fixation on the future allowed for randomness in historical writing, as any information could have relevance due to its “grand design of God” (Medieval Mirror, p. 120). This aspect allowed the rise in popularity of chronology, as information without narrative was ripe for interpretation for divine intervention. 

- History in the middle ages was defined by its adherence to religious belief and its ability to conduct moral lessons (Popkin p. 39). Classical qualities of history, notably stressing “absolute truth” and literary value were repurposed to reflect this new Christian doctrine (Medieval Mirror p. 100-101). To move away from *rhetoric* and push towards *moral values* perhaps appealed to the uneducated masses. This might be why this method fell in use during the Renaissance and the increase in education.

- The sources best associated with the Medieval period were annals and chronicles by local historians (Popkin p. 41). This was most seen from Eusebius to the beginning of the Renaissance (Medieval Mirror, p. 118). These types of sources naturally have less rhetoric and literary analysis than the popular works of histories past, which contributed to their popularity in Christendom Europe. However, the lines between chronological sources and historical source were also blurred during this time (Medieval Mirror, p. 120).  

- Chinese history under the Tang dynasty saw the most advanced historical methods during their reign (Popkin p. 42). This was due to their familiarity of Greco-Roman tradition, as well as creating an official History Bureau (Popkin p.42). The Islamic world also established Greco-Roman roots in their writings, creating “probing” historical thought that was unrivaled by European historians (Popkin p.42). These civilizations were highlighted to emphasize the Christian biases of Western Europe, and how their methods stagnated the evolution of historiographical methods.  

- History as a subject saw an ever-expanding audience in the late middle ages due to population and urban booms as well as increases in literacy due to universities (Popkin p. 43-44). This may have been a contribution to the blurring of chronicles and history as genres in the later Middle Ages (Medieval Mirror p. 121). 

- Oftentimes Christian historians justified the prominence of *barbarians* in Europe by fabricating origin stories to align with Christian backgrounds. (Medieval Mirror p. 113). This is in line with the tactic of history being utilized as a lesson to Christian values.
