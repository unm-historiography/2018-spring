### Medieval Historiography Questions
1. Popkin describes Sima Quian's _Shiji_ as "more of an encyclopedia" than a historical narrative despite _Shiji_ including biographies, accounts of past dynasties, and other historical facts (p. 35). What features **must** be present, if any, for a piece of writing to be defined as a _historical_ narrative?

2. Popkin claims that the disintegration of Rome led to a decline of "those who received the kind of education that would allow them to become historians" (p. 38). He implies that without access to the works of Greco-Roman historians you _cannot become_ a historian. Is Popkin's claim regarding education valid for students today? Does this argument impact the importance of other cultural histories?

3. Is the lack of truth and "sophistication" seen in European medieval history reflective of the priorities of the era (p 39-40, 42)? Is there any value in these works if the truth is not the primary priority?

4. _History in the Medieval Mirror_ discusses at length the difference between chroniclers and historians (p. 119-121). Do we as a society and a discipline need both chroniclers and historians? Are various methods of historical writings useful and contribute to a richer overall understanding? If not, is there one superior way to write about past events?
