## *History in the Medieval Mirror*
   We have established that history aims to tell the truth. However, do chronicles do a better job of telling the truth? Two orders of writing are discussed: chronological order and logical order (p.102).Chronicles give us a list of factual events in chronological order, whereas history adds a narrative to facts and tells them in logical order. It is stated that chroniclers are in fact more truthful than historians due to their chronological writing style (p.120). It is pertinent to understand the meaning of **truth** in this context. Both chroniclers and historians aim to tell the truth, however, their rhetorical skills differ and paint different narratives. Telling a story in chronological order does not allow room for interpretation or criticism, only for straight facts as they happened. Telling a story in logical order allows for the historian to both interpret and criticize the situation at hand.
