### Medieval Questions
Jerome T. Mondragon

1. It's speculated that the Arthur Legend was a fabrication of Geoffry of Monmouth. (Popkin 43-44) What are the potential benifits or purpose for creating this legend? Can it be regarded as cultural history for Britain?

2. Many Medieval historians have been criticized for elaboration in their writings. Jordanes was criticized by scholars for his inaccuracies about the Goths. (pg. 107) Given the information that these historians have to work with, how much leeway should historians take in interpreting history?

 3. Medieval historical texts were mainly reserved for clergyman. (Popkin 39) Can anyone gain access to ancient texts provided they know Greek or Latin?
