### Marxist History
1. Does the fact that Marx is trained as a philosopher (Roakmore, p.488) **aid** or **affect** his historical work?
2. Marx suggests that we only know human history because **we construct it** (p.489). Is this accurate?
3. Marx's philosophy of history is **based solely on the economy and its' development** (491). Is this an accurate way to observe history? Through what other lenses can we observe history?
4. Marx refers to **Vico** and states that human history differs from nature in that history is constructed by humans, whereas nature is not (p.495). What does this mean for the truth in history? 
5. In claas, we have discussed cyclical narratives of history. Marx believes in a **linear narrative to history** (Green, p.1175). Does this linear narrative aid the historical message? If not, why?
6. Is class struggle esssential to history and its' narrative? (p.1220).
7. Women, even though they make up part of the classes that are being discussed, are excluded from the narrative. In a sense Marx, and those that follow, create a masculine depiction of the classes. How does the exclusion of women from Marx's narrative (p. 1280) affect the story? Does this take away from Marx's credibility?
8. Does **Christopher Hill** give a convincing explanation of labour history and the working class?
