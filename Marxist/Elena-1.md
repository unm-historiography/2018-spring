The writings and ideas of Karl Marx have helped to shape much of history for the last couple of centuries (communist regimes, multiple Red Scares, etc.). Marxism, as his philosophy would be called, not only changed how people viewed society but also how they thought about history. From a teleological standpoint, it could be argued that previous historiographical traditions (particularly those of the early modern era and beyond) were leading up to the Marxist model. 


The Marxist approach to studying history is one that finds a correlation between economic factors, human society, and human history. The socioeconomic status of a person is determined by their relation to the “forces of production” (*Houses*, p. 35). While a philosopher and a historian, Marx was also an economist who thought about history in a more “scientific” manner. His ideas can be seen as a direct successor to the “positivism” movement started by Auguste Comte (a French contemporary of Marx) (Popkin, p. 87-88). While Marx was not imitating Comte’s example, both shared ideas about the “inevitability of progress and the need for scholarship about the past to model itself on the procedures” of the sciences (Popkin, p. 87). In Marx’s case, the procedures of economics.


Speaking of progress, Marxist history was a continuation of and an expansion on Enlightenment historiography. He wrote at great lengths about a possible post-capitalist society, where people “are freed from the constraints of earning a living,” resulting in a “reconciliation” with nature and the heightening of their senses (Rockmore, p. 493). He also continued the Enlightenment tradition of dividing history into eras. In the case of the Marxist tradition, the three eras of society: ancient, feudal, and capitalist (“or modern bourgeois”) society, “each the product of a progressively more advanced mode of production” (*Houses*, p. 35). The fourth era of “socialism” would then emerge as a result of the working class overthrowing the bourgeoisie (*Houses*, p. 36). The era of socialism can only come about if the working class, or proletariat, become aware of the fact that they are subjugated (tying back to the Marxist model of progress). 


As previously stated, Marx emphasized the role of the proletariat, or working class, in history. While predating the Annales school by decades, Marxist history inadvertently inspired the ideals of that school. As British historian Raphael Samuel put it, “Marxist historiography was chronologically preceded by, and has always had to co-exist with, a more broadly based and less theoretically demanding ‘people’s history’” (*Houses*, p. 33). Marx was not a forerunner of the “total history” model of the Annales, and the group’s “open and flexible approach … contrasted sharply with the rigid guidelines dictated by the ‘scientific’ scholarship of the nineteenth century” (Popkin, p. 112). In other words, Marxist history and total history are two different models. However, both models worked towards acknowledging the history of peoples who had been largely ignored by academia for centuries (namely, the lower and working classes): a history from below as it is known today.
