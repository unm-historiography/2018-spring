# Marx: A Step in the Evolution of History

Though Karl Marx was inspired by---and has inspired---many a revolution, the theories of his writings were merely the *next step* in the **evolution** of history. Marx himself would appreciate the sentiment that he was the necessary stepping stone from one stage of history to the next, as the dialectical model of his theories are based on such ideas **(Rockmore, p. 488)**. In two ways, *especially*, Marx was evolutionary: his ideas were based on the **cyclical patterns** of human nature, established by his historiographical predecessors; and the basis of his *original* arguments were largely bound by the **scientific method**, which were intended to be read as **scientific truth**, a sign of his times.

The first, and propbably most important, of these points is that *Karl Marx did not exist in a vaccuum* and had to have been influenced by at least one historian that preceded him. Giambattista Vico is a preceding historian that saw history in terms of **defined and unavoidable** cycles of growth and decay **(Popkin, p. 60)**. Vico's writings came at least a century before Marx was reading and writing---with an even greater distance of time between them and Marx's development of complex hisoriographical theories **(Green and Toup, p. 34)**. What sets Marx further along the evolutionary timeline of history is that his writings underscores the *pattern* of human history, without stating the same unachievable *definitives* that Vico's do **(Green and Toup, p. 35/ Popkin, p. 60)**. The idea that there is a defined pattern of human development was not first established by Marx, but it was reshaped and redefined by him in terminologies that modernized it, and put it into measurable qualifications **(Rockmore, p. 489-91)**.

Science in history, or the science of history, was the main topic of historiographical discussions throughout most of the nineteenth century **(Popkin, p. 97)**. Again, Marx could not have existed in a vaccuum where--over the course of his life (1818-1883)--he did not encounter a *single example* of Leopold Ranke's writing, who was the foremost mind in "scientific history" **(Gil, p. 383)**. Marx's collegue and protege Friedrich Engles once compared him to *Charles Darwin*, in terms of development within their respective fields the comparison is ill-suited---at best---leaving Marx as a "scientific historian" with no concrete credentials for such a title **(Rockmore, p. 489)**. The *nature* of Marx's writings were scientific--or at least were intended to be--and were **produced during the breakthough era of Scientific History **(Rockmore, Green and Troup)**. Marx, however, was not the first---nor was he the only---historian to use steps from the **scientific method** in his research and writing. Although he did achieve **ends** that differed from other historians of his time. It was those ends, though mismatched and jumbled, that set Marx apart and allowed his writing to become a **platform** upon which modern historians still build their theses atop: a way station on the timeline of history, an evolution in our understanding of historiography.

9: very nice. need also to address what many would argue is Marx's key innovation, namely his focus on class dynamics and conflict, esp as a driver of historical change. can you also make an argument how even this aspect can be seen as evolutionary?
