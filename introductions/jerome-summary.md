# FHTH-Chapter 1 Summary
Jerome T. Mondragon

  - We study history for many reasons: it produces a sense of identity (p. 17), a guide in studying human behavior (p. 16), it holds world leaders accountable (p. 17), and most importanly because it's interesting! (p. 18) 
  - Historical information was originally retrieved from archival data but now encompases digital media-often from the internet. Historical reseaqrch was traditionally published in scholarly articles and books but are now translated through movies, video games, and websites. (p.11)
  - There are many ways to define Historiography. One way to define it as the "critical assesment by Historians to reconstruct past events as distinguished from the statements they make about the past." (p. 3) It's also defined as the history of history (p.3) and a narrative about narratives. (p. 5) 
  - Historiography is often a rite of passage for aspiring historians. They'll become informed critics of historical work, (p. 10) and will obtain the necessary skills to produce historical knowledge. (p. 6) 
  - Historians have the responsibility of reconstructing the past and decides what constitutes historical knowledge. (p. 8) Students will get a better appreciation of historians and their work because of their extensive training and the effort in creating historical work. (p. 10)
  - Forget everything you learned about history! History books were written for a specific audience which includes a dramatic stories and colorful characters. Facts are concrete and unquestionable. Historiographic students come to understand that history isn't always concrete and events are questionable. (p. 5)
  - Historiography can be disheartening. Popular history is much different from academic history. (p. 9) Students are asked to forget everything that attracted them to them to the subject in the first place. (p. 5)
  - There are different sub-branches of history:
Political History- The study of politics within a country. (p. 19)
