Group 2: Questions
1.	How can we be critical of biased, propagandistic, and inaccurate presentations of history, without rejecting the importance of forms of history, meant for general audiences? Why is it important to identify the biases that arise from personal investments to subjects by historians?

2.	How have the histories/stories of the “Others,” or those whose stories have been systematically repressed, altered the way historians look at historiography and the way history has generally been understood and represented throughout time? Why is it important to both address individuals memory, as well as, the collective memory?

3.	How can individuals or groups in relevant fields, such as law, politics, advertisement, etc.…, besides history and academia, use the same critical tools that historiography evaluates and why is it beneficial?

4.	How is new media playing an increasing role is the way we research, write, and teach history? What are some of those credible media outlets that are available for critical assessment? 

5.	In what ways do the sources of political, diplomatic, and military history vary from the sources used in social, micro, and cultural history? How have social and cultural histories become more prevalent in our modern age and why is important to historiographers?
