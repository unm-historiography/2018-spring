Week 1 Questions -Jacob Martinez
Popkins pgs 1-24

1.	Do our personal perspectives lack when we feel the need to ask questions about history? Do we rely on history for answers in the present?

2.	When we feel these questions come up, what is it in history that draws us to the answer? 

3.	Can we ever really answer questions about the past in a satisfying manner?

4.	If our unease in the present draws us to history should it be our role to share the past in any possible way?

5.	Does our rapidly changing world with such a massive amount of info mean humans will ever be able to accept the past as resolved? 

6.	If history found online cannot be held to the same scrutiny as pure academic work can we trust this information with the public? 

7.	Should we strictly aim to fix broken/misinformed public knowledge on history?

8.	Does the notion that important people will be strictly scrutinized for their actions by future historians actually keep them accountable for current affairs?
