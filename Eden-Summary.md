## Summary: Ancient History 

* The history of history has been written from a Western perspective, with focus on the "developments of modern historical thinking" within this part of the world (Popkin, p. 25). 
* Ethnocentricism is something even the Romans, in their obsession with property and civic growth, were guilty of in their depictions of history (*Roman Foundations*, p. 48). 
* Herodotus and Thucydides, in the 5th century B.C.E. came to the conclusion that history **should be** the story of the deeds of humans, along with exceptional events that affected whole societies (Popkin, p. 27).
* Thucydides used prose in his writings, without rhetoric, which still serves as model for modern telling of history (Popkin, p. 28). However, he used rhetoric in his speeches, which served a political use (*Roman Foundations*, p. 65). 
* Herodotus has been given tribute as the first historian to write about the struggle for freedom as a central theme, but also is called "the father of lies" as he told many exaggerations within his histories (Popkin, p. 29). 
* The ancient work of the "father of Roman history" Fabius Pictor, was written in the 3rd century (*Roman Foundations*, p. 52). 
* Livy wrote military, political, and institutional history (*Roman Foundations*, p 56). In order to promote Rome over the period of centuries, Livy collected and evaluated sources from the past (Popkin, p. 31).
* The collection of this data was called "archaeology" by the Greeks, which meant "covering matters which were obscure both because of their great antiquity...and because...there were few written records" (*Roman Foundations*, 59). 
* The Greek and Roman historians wrote for a limited audience. History remained largely told orally through stories, while written history was preserved by the elite (Popkin, p. 35).
