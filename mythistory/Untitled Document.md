### **Emily Delcoure**
# Week 2 Questions
•	Who assumes the role of interpreter in historical matters? Is it other historians—even ones that have a tendency of calling competing historians liars, (p.6)? Or should it be a more neutral third party?
•	Should an interpretive check be put on historical works in the first place? How could this cause issues to arise? 
•	When McNeill refers to “scientific history,” what is he trying to say about the validity of 19th century Cambridge writings and writers? (p. 2)
•	Are these *“scientific”* historians inherently more accurate because they read more, or does the accuracy lie in the sources themselves? (p. 2)
•	What is your personal connotation of the word **historical**? Do you have multiple connotations? Can it even be confined? Is your interpretation more reflective of you, or of the historians that came before? (p. 2)
•	What is your personal connotation of the word **truth**? Do you have multiple connotations? Can it even be confined? Is your interpretation more reflective of you, or of the humans that came before? (p. 3)
•	Is the reader being called to be more critical of historical works? If not, what—if anything—should be taken away from McNeill’s work?
