Summary-Myth and History 

1. Academic History began with the goal creating a “science” (P.1) like chronological organization of facts about the past. The premise was flawed in its ability to eliminate the biases of Historians about details of events. However, scientific historic research provided an immense consolidation of historical “data” (P.2) to be drawn from archives. (P.1-2)

2. As historical research evolved the true intellectual value of history emerged as an ability to critically analyze and organize events in a meaningful way. History at its core was pattern recognition of human groups; recognition akin to the ways natural scientists create theories on behavior. (P.2)

3. Historians thrive on the pursuit of truth, but what they find instead is that the principle of truth is a malleable idea that’s formed in every human group. Truth is relative to the groups who develop it whether religious, political, or academic and through the “marketplace of ideas” (P.4) a larger self-evident truth will emerge. History know serves as a function to revive the truths of forgotten groups and revise the accepted forms of previous truths. (P.3-4)

4. The identity of groups leads feeling the need to define who “We” are. The idea of “we” forms a strong self-identity and as a result the lens that we observe the world is inherently self-centered. The ethnocentric world view we grow with often leads to an us vs them mentality about different groups. (P.5)

5. Historians need to exercise caution when examining a group. Identity conflict leads to an intricate balance; empathy and objective facts must be employed to neither alienate nor weaponize national identities. The power of identity is reliant on the ability to define “us and them” (P.7), and Historians directly tribute to the self-perceived identity of a group. (P.6-7) 

6. Truths are an abstract concept especially when they are beholden to the available texts. Examining the patterns with the available limited sources can provided a coherent and meaningful examination of truths that may not outwardly appear in the raw data of texts (P.8)

7. History has evolved into the search for “mythhistory”. This goal is founded on the faiths that in the search for absolute truth historians will have uncovered a nuanced and sizable foundations of the past that reflect with an expanded awareness of social development. (P.9)

8. If historians continue to advance their Awareness in the search for truth, the fundamental principles of excellent historic scholarship will extend into the public domain. (P.10)
