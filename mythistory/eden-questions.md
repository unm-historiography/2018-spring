# **Mythistory Discussion/Questions**
**1**. What does McNeill say about avoiding being *"flattering"* with the groups of people we (will eventually) write about as historians? (**p. 5**) How can we avoid this, and why is it important to do so? 

**2**. We must avoid calling "*trivia the truth*". How can we learn to discern this as historians? (**p. 8**)

**3**. Written histories have the power to shape one's existence **and** reality. How can the historian change other's perceptions with the use of mythistory? (**p. 10**) 

**4**. Mythistory seeks to "pilot" our experiences with the environment and with each other. How can this be a powerful tool for understanding and seeking the "*truth*" within history? (**p. 10**)

**5**. Is truth within mythistory something that is sought after at *all* times, or does that change depending on current societal pressures and desirs? (**p. 10**)
