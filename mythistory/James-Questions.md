                                                       Mythistory Questions
Question 1: McNeill states that “the liberal faith, of course, holds that in a free marketplace of ideas, truth will eventually prevail,”
(p.4). Christopher Columbus is a well-known historical figure in mainstream America but in recent years, human rights activists have 
started the movement to change “Columbus Day” to “Indigenous People’s Day.” Do you believe that historical falsehoods perpetuated by
popular history will be dismantled by objective historians? 

Question 2: Good historians seek the truth with objectivity while popular history can promote myths (p.1). There are some patriotic 
Americans who believe in the concept of American exceptionalism; the belief that America is a unique leader for countries across the world 
because of its values of liberty and freedom. In certain circumstances, are certain myths beneficial to a nation and should we promote 
them? 

Question 3: McNeill explains the dilemma that historians face by stating that “myth making for rival groups has become a dangerous game
in the atomic age, and we may well ask whether there is any alternative open to us,” (p.7). McNeill goes on to write that it is the “moral 
duty” of historians to de-escalate conflicts in society. What specific actions could historians undertake to decrease tensions and conflict 
between “rival groups?” 

Question 4: According to McNeill, “eternal and universal truth about human behavior is an unattainable goal,” (p.9). In accordance to 
McNeill's beliefs about the inherent and inevitable disagreements about historical events, trends and individuals, will myths or 
“mythistory” always be a part of the study of history?
