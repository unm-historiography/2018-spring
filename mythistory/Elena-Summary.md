Summary:  William H. McNeill, “Mythistory, or Truth, Myth, History, and Historians,” p. 1-10

* Myth and history are similar in that both tell stories of “how things got to be the way they are,” but they are different in that the former is fictional while the latter is fact. However, one historian can dismiss the conclusions of another historian by calling it “mythical.” “One historian’s truth becomes another’s myth,” as McNeill phrases it (p. 1).

* Natural scientists and historians alike engage in pattern recognition in their line of work, but historians “seek to understand” a “greater complexity” of human behavior than natural scientists (p. 2). 

* Humans, being “social creatures,” have “the need to share truths with one another.” Not just scientific truths but also truths “about human relations and the people around us” (p. 3).

* The pressure on historians to portray certain groups in a flattering way results in a “mingling of truth and falsehood, blending history with ideology” (p. 5).

* Such mythical accounts result in history being simplified into black and white/”us” versus “them” scenarios (p. 5).

* “Flattering historiography” can be helpful in that emphasizing a nation’s positive qualities can lead to greater unity among its people. On the other hand, such a historiography can lead to a distrust of foreigners (p. 6).

* Historians throughout the ages sought to remedy such problems by providing accounts of different perspectives or emphasizing commonalities present in humanity as a whole (p. 7).

* Despite the issues that can arise from it, “mythistory” is still “a useful instrument for piloting human groups in their encounters with one another and with the natural environment.” Hopefully, future generations of historians can “persevere and do even better” (p. 10).
