Summary-Myth and History

•	Myth and history both tell some sort of a story, yet myth is considered to be false and history is considered to be true. A historian might declare someone else’s conclusion to be false and therefore mythical, while accepting his or her own conclusion to be true. (pg. 2)

•	Scientific source criticism has often arranged facts into a readable narrative to produce scientific history and has been considered previously to be true and eternal, yet over time we have realized that the arrangement of facts to create a historical narrative must involve subjective judgements and intellectual choices, which has little to do with scientific criticism. (pg. 2)

•	Pattern recognition is what natural scientists and historians have done, either consciously or unconsciously. Natural science is neither external nor universal, but historical and evolutionary. This is because scientists accept a new theory only when the new embraces a wider range of phenomena or achieves a better explanation of selectively observed facts than previously posed. (pg. 3)

•	Unlike natural scientists, historians desire and hope to attain the greater complexity of behavior. Human beings react to the natural world and the mediation of symbols. Often, any theory about human life will alter actual behavior; inducing people to act as if the theories were true. (pg. 3)

•	Human beings are social creatures who share general, as well as, specific truths about the physical world and about human behavior. Without these shared truths groups have no social cement that allows for longevity and preservation, yet those truths can be perceived as myth. Also, those shared truths create social and ideological fragmentation and isolation. (pg. 4)

•	Formal history, with its center on the Western perspective, became useful in defining “us” versus “them”. Historians often blend history and ideology, due to the perpetual temptation and to conform to expectations that people have to be portrayed how they want to. Historical details can indicate if a group falls short or attains those desired ideals, which results in myth. (pg. 6)

•	Complete reproduction of human experience is impossible. (pg. 9) Modern historians attempt to enhance commonalities of all humanity, including triumphs and tribulations, but a wise historian will not disparage or criticize the importance of small groups. (pg. 8)

•	 Mythistory is a useful tool for fro guiding human groups in their encounters with one another and the natural environment. Historians, to some degree, can only expect to be successful if they incorporate what people want to hear, but can only expect to useful if they also tell the people things they are reluctant to hear. (pg. 11)
