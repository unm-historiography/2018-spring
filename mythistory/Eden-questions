# **Mythistory Discussion/Questions**
**1**. What does McNeill say about avoiding being *"flattering"* with the groups of people we (will eventually) write about as historians? (p. 5) How can we avoid this, and why is it important to do so? 

**2**. We must avoid, as historians, calling "trivia the truth". How can we learn to discern this as historians? (p. 8)

**3**. Written histories have the power to shape one's existence and reality. How can the historian change other's perceptions on their own history? Have **your** realities changed? (p. 10) 

**4**. Mythistory seeks to "pilot" our experiences with the environment and with each other. How can this be a powerful tool for understanding each other from a different perspective?
