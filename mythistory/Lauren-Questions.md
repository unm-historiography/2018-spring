1) How does the author, *McNeill*, want us as historians to re-evaluate the notion that History needs to seek the absolute **"Truth"** for the human experience? How can being too dedicated to the "facts" (such as researching each possible primary document within a field of study) become too narrow a viewpoint when relaying an important narrative to the general public? What might a historian miss out on if they are only willing to see things from one perspective? **(p. 1)**

2) Why might the study of History not be as "truthful" as we like to think it is? Can you give an example where one historian's truth might become another's myth?

3) *McNeill* applauds the work of past historians, but he also purposes that there are limits to **scientific history**. Why does he feel this way? What are the limits as *McNeiil* sees them and do you agree with this assessment? **(pg.1-2,5-6)**

4) The author suggests that having too much choice from multiple **idea-systems** (psychology, economics, etc.) can create chaos and confusion for historians. Individuals will compete to prove their theory of history over another's narrative. Yet, *McNeill* also believes a **"free marketplace of ideas"** can benefit the pursuit for "historical truth". How might this be the case? What examples can you give from the article and current events that support the author's "faith" in the **liberal experiment**? **(p. 4)**

5) Why does *McNeill* feel "total group commitment" to a historical narrative is sometimes harmful for both historians and individuals within and outside a group (ie Nationalists vs foreign countries)?  Why should historians be careful not to exclude certain groups as well? **(p.7-8)**

6) How have historical truths evolved? Do you agree with *McNeill* that our collective history will continue to grow and evolve? Will that history be able to omit the **"background noise"** yet still represent minority groups (Women, Native Americans, African Americans, etc.) previously left behind in the history books? **(p. 9)**
