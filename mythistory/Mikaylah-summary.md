###Mythistory
*Myths and history both tell stories; however, myths are untrue while history seeks to be truthful (p.1).
*Scientific history has many limitations due to its' tendency to list facts rather then engage an individual intellectually to the ideas behind the facts (p.2).
*Pattern recognition is performed by historians. This is the recognition that only some facts matter to the bigger picture (p.2).
*Historians will never reach the same conclusions. There will always be discourse between historians! (p.2)
*Humans are meant to live a social life and question their past and future (p.3).
*History helps define the different groups within society; this creates shared truths among people and divides society even further (p.5).
*Historians are pressured to write about groups as the groups want to be remembered (p.6). For this reason, many historians become the enemy when writing about a specific group of people. To avoid this, many historiographers try to tell both sides to the same story (p.7).
*We, as historians in trainig, need to help develope a more diverse history and say both what a group wants to hear and what they need to hear (p.7,10).
