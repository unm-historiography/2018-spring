## Sociology and History Don't Really Have "Key Differences"

I'm still not sure what sociology is _exactly_ supposed to be (although I expect that it's as nebulous as history is, as a discipline), but if Weber is to be believed, **sociology is a way to measure humanity** so that it "**formulate[s] models or types and general rules or patterns of social events**" **(p. 112)**. Following Weber's idea of what sociology is and does, it's _superior_ to history- **history, after all, only "casually" observes events (p. 112)**. This _can't_ be an _accurate measurement of the value these disciplines hold_ though, because even though **Weber believes that they are closely related, but different enterprises**, there seems to be far **more evidence** that **history and sociology strive to achieve the same goals**, the only real difference seeming to be that different methods of writing history answer the different questions that unified sociology can address by itself **(p.112)**.

For one example, if **sociology aims to explain the development of the modern world**, then **Marxist history fills the same role (p.114)**. Both focus on the role of **capitalism** as _motivation_ for "social events" in modern history. For example, **modernization theory argues that countries would become rich under capitalism (p. 115)**. The **sociologist** Wallerstein used historical observation that since Europe advanced faster than African nations, and exploited other non-European nations from the 1400s on, they were _able to remain more advanced than the other nations_, and thus _had better control of wealth and world economy_ **(p. 115)**. A **Marxist historian** would likely observe the same events and come to a similar conclusion- _the advantaged nations_ (Europe) _remained in control because of their privileged position_ (they advanced technologically faster) **(p. 36)**. This _class disparity_, caused by the growing capitalist system, or the rising of technology, and the increased focus on production, would then lead to the failure of modernization theory as well **(p. 38)**. 

Even the importance of the specifically **scientific method of researching societal events** is shared between sociology and history. As the **Renaissance** occurred, history developed into a discipline that required the _strict, scientific evaluation of historical evidence_, especially through the use of source documents **(FHTH, p. 68-94)**. **Sociology** likewise subjects the evidence it uses to _scientific scrutiny_. Skocpol demonstrates this by her criticism of using _literature_ as evidence because of its _inconsistencies with accepted historical records_ **(p. 118)**. The standards for acceptable evidence then are the same- consistency, for one example, is important.  

9: but isn't a different method of writing a significant difference between the disciplines? and from where does that difference come? if it's from different methods, then that's even more significant. your argument that the GOALS are the same, and a claim that the "scientific" rigor is there in both cases is spot on, but thinking more about methods and sources would have pushed you a bit further. part of the confusion is the different b/w sociology generally and historical sociology, which isn't explained well enough in the reading. side note: no need to bold page numbers--the extra bolding detracts from highlighting your good ideas!
