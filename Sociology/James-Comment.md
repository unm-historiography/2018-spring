***A More Complete Picture: History v. Sociology***

The study of history consists of various fields, disciplines and specializations that **go far beyond sociology’s narrow scope. History otten looks at individual leaders and ideologies** instead of only seeing through sociology’s limited lens of class conflict and societal institutions. However, those lens can overlap with historians such as Karl Marx (Green, p. 47). Historians, such as Machiavelli in the 15th and 16th century Renaissance period, have examined the decisions, ambitions and legacy of historical leaders like Alexander (Machiavelli, p. 19). Instead of analyzing the institution framework that restricted Alexander, Machiavelli was able to explain why Alexander’s personality and decisions shaped the course of history.  Even important historical figures such as Julius Caesar have used their own stories and accounts to alter the study of history itself. Caesar’s “Gallic Wars” book proved to “established a precedent for memoirs written by military and political leaders to describe their own accomplishments" (Popkin, p. 33). **The contributions of individual figures are analyzed in historical studies while sociology would brush it off as an extension of a bigger social institution.** 

Sociologists complete a fervent study of the classes and societal institutions that impact a country. In Skocpol’s historical work about historical sociology, he focuses on France's, China's and Russia's class structure and societal institutions (court system, military framework, economic system and power structure) to provide reasoning for each country’s “social revolution” (Green, p. 144). As the two historians, Sewell and Stone, correctly point out, Skocpol’s study of historical sociology does not provide a sufficient explanation of the ideologies surrounding the “social revolutions” he covers (Green, p. 138). **At no point did Skocpol elaborate on the ideologies that drove those revolutions.** A proper historical work would have covered how the revolutionaries used their beliefs of liberty and equality to support the French Revolution and how Russian and Chinese revolutionaries used communism and equality for their respective revolutions. 

Due to historians like Ranke, **facts and evidence are at the heart of modern history** (Popkin, p. 76). However, sociology is prone to get wrapped up in myths and the ideological predispositions of the individual sociologist's country (Green, p. 138). Skocpol even described this realization as “frustrating” because sociologists do not have the “time” or “historical skills” to complete the “necessary primary research” (Green, p. 138). This key distinction is essential to understanding history’s objective reality in contrast to ascertaining the **“theoretical” and culturally slanted viewpoint of sociology** (Green, p. 146). As Ranke states, historians should “show what actually happened” while sociologists initially look to test theories and assumptions made about classes and society’s institutions (Popkin, p. 76). In contrast, historians seek the truth the first and then they provide narratives. Instead of only providing an ideologically skewed viewpoint on a society’s social structure, the study of history can grant their audiences narratives, relative objectivity and a more complete picture.
