### Glorious Confusion Summary

- The mid-1960s saw a public and student demand for a "new understanding" of history. Previous historical certainties and the value of history itself were questioned. Students in the US, France , and China wanted to see a history that reflected their current worldview and historical professionals raced to adapt. Racial inequalities, eurocentrism, labor unions, gender, and the history of the lower classes were being given a spotlight. (FHTH pg. 128-129)
- Some history professors began to revamp their curriculum and class room settings to meet the demands of students. **Carl Schorske** created **“satellite seminars"** allowing students to actively engage in discussions and interpretations about the past. History was allowed to be viewed from multiple perspectives. (pg. 129)
- Although the pressure from students eventually died down heading into the 1970s, historiography was nevertheless impacted and is still seeing implications of those changes today. The floodgates were open to debate whether new approaches to understanding history were beneficial for representing a history **"from the bottom up"** or corrosive to established norms allowing for redefinitions of history that could deny important historical events like the Holocaust (pg 130)
- Demographic history and  **“cliometrics"** were developed to offer a statistically based approach to understanding the lives of past peoples combining data and making correlations based on rates of mortality, census data, population booms, etc. This allowed for an approach to history that could be linked to the "hard" social sciences, but often fell short for giving the data human empathy turning the peoples of the past into only a "collection of numbers" (pg 131-133).
- The **“paradigm shift”** of academia coined by **Thomas Kuhn** and reflected in historical writings such as **Lynn Hunt's** *Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution*. In Kuhn’s view, new theories of history resulted from changes in historians' view on peoples and societies rather than an evolution of historical research methods. Historical truth was to be seen as subjective (pg 134-135).
-**Hayden White’s Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe**, angered many historians and academic scholars for its proposal that historians were only narrators and that historical writings were not far from being works of fiction. Historians responded by denouncing White's work, but also more critical of their own work, being careful of their "reshaping of the past" (pg 136-137).**Michel Foucault** introduced the idea of **"micro-politics"** proposing that politics were reflected in the everyday lives of people not just governments. Historians themselves were engaged in the politics of a power struggle to prove their worth through knowledge based on the "evidence" excluded or collected in research and source citations. (pg. 138).
- The 1970s saw a shift at the Annales school and with historical thinking to a **"third level"** which focused on the **"notion of mentalities"** offering a look into history of everyday life developing into **"microhistories"**. The accounts and perspectives from ordinary individuals' lives could be just as important to creating a total history. Microhistories could also offer another way to enhance the public interest in history. People were able to relate and empathize with individuals of the past who potentially reflected their own lives (pg 139-141). In contrast, some historians criticized the "new cultural" historical methods as diminishing the importance of overall change within societies, shifting ideologies, and the roles of governments and political leaders (pg. 142).
- The role of women and **gender history** saw a rise during 1970s as well. Female historians argued for more opportunity and respect within academia. Criticism of a patriarchal past emphasized that women had often been left out of the history books entirely and their accomplishments had been ignored. Outright backlash and threats from some male historians didn't stop female historians from excersing their right to study history and reflect the perspectives of **"herstory"** in history (pg 143-145). Challenge of exclusivity within gender politics though, discussions and arguments mainly arguing for upper-class heterosexual white women.  Questioning of the construction of gender itself (pg. 145)
- Previous Eurocentric histories were questioned and coitized for often disregarding other world histories or putting the accomplishments of other nations within the context of European innovations first. The literary critic **Edward Said** asserted that **Orientalism**, "had denied non- European societies any real history of their own". The role of oral histories was also re-emphasized. **Richard Price** argued that African oral narratives could be directly compared to written accounts from Europeans offering an alternative viewpoint of historical events. **Alessandro Portelli** stated “The importance of oral testimony may lie not in its adherence to fact, but rather in its departure from it, as imagination, symbolism, and desire emerge.” (pg. 152).
- The **History of Memory** was a concept developed during the 1970s and 1980s leading into the "history wars". A collective **"memory boom"** with interest in museums, historical films, theme parks, and historical site tours. The role witness accounts played in accounts of historical events was also questioned thought historians were hard pressed to tell survivors of wars and past traumas that their memories of the events may be inaccurate. (pg. 149-153).
- Counter culture of **“history wars”**. Popular culture and historical thought being combined. Historians arguing whether this is beneficial or detrimental to the field and accuracy of history. What is true in a historical narrative in a film or staged television program? Does it matter if the interest of history has been increased in general?  Different perspectives can at the very least be compared to previous historical norms; better to question then just assume previous assertions are absolute and accurate. Direct contradictions to **Peter Novick’s** assertion that the new histories have destroyed the study of history itself (pg 149, 152, 155-156).
