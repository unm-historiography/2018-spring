Week 7
Herodotus to H-Net Summary 

•	War, Inequality, and a faltering economy; elements in the changing world that drove an extreme counter movement to the status quo. *By the late sixties university students demanded classes that would be more relevant to their lives.* Historians moved to represent these trends searching for new methods in which to understand the difficult global cultural of conflict. **Historians began pursuing a collective peoples history focused on telling the history of marginalized cultures.** (p.127-9)

•	*“Paradigm Shift”* was used to describe the intense academic upheaval of the traditional historical norm. Thomas Kuhn’s belief that **historic scholarship represented the present beliefs of historians rather than built from a collective basis of past professional works.** Historians attempted to bring new academic tools from social/scientific fields to further their own work *changing the examination of the past to fit current social dynamics, making history more relative to modern movements.* (P.130-4)


•	Naturally with the inclusion of marginalized histories and profound new ideas about linguistic study in academia caused reimagining of an established *“grand narrative”*. **History was infinitely more complex in its machinations with no two cultures exhibiting a total parallel.**  The split structural narrative of various societies implicated an idea that individual and cultural development was shaped by the perceptions their own social surroundings.** Bordering on sociological study histories place in academia became a blurred experiment in the promotion of cultural change. (P.139)

•	Part of the expanding historical universe was the natural evolution into *”microhistory”*. This isolated format of history took a grand step towards the Annales school ultimate goal of a total history.  **By looking at individual minor actors in historical developments historians were able to create a larger and more telling recreation of events.** Further highlighting the actions of minor characters history fulfilled a people’s history telling the stories of working class citizens and their lives. (P.140)

•	Following the movements of the 1970’s the second wave of Feminism exploded into the academic world. The female historical narrative also fell into a category that had been systemically ignored. **Female scholars like Natalie Zemon Davis and Gerda Lerner quickly expanded upon the forgotten half of the population’s part building humanity.** The impressive feminist catalog of historical work began to challenge the conceived notions of the past predicated on exemplifying the glories and follies of men alone.  (P.145)

•	Further attempts to expand minority scholarship focused on finding groups that had been historically exempt from the Euro-centric success story of the western world. **The increased sensitivity to a homogenous world view drew saw old dangerous perspectives about marginalized groups brought to light and critisized.** These groups ranged from gender identities, to African and Asian cultures (p.149). 

•	History of memory style scholarship came into style by the works of Pierre Nora. *His style drew on early 20th century sociological methodology piecing together a nuanced view of a cultures identity.* But, providing framework for individuals to glorify or exclude a nation’s worst moments can be a dangerous practice providing incentive for nationalistic movements (P.152)

•	As historians grew apart from a unified style in history the profession underwent a crisis of identity. A global climate that was undergoing extreme political change led to a *”culture war”* over history. **Historians continue to struggle in finding a comfortable balance between easily accessible history and the chaotic landscape of professional academia.** In the United States this conflict has ensured that public perception of history is often left flawed at best. (P.150-63)
