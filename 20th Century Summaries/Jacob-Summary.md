Week 7
Herodotus to H-Net Summary 

•	War, Inequality, and a faltering economy; elements in the changing world that drove an extreme counter movement to the status quo. *By the late sixties university students demanded classes that would be more relevant to their lives.* Historians moved to represent these trends searching for new methods in which to understand the difficult global cultural of conflict. **Historians began pursuing a collective peoples history focused on telling the history of marginalized cultures.** (p.127-9) The history of the minority became the status quo for modern historians seeing less as a targeted marxist study and more so a nuanced understanding of various diciplines.

•	*“Paradigm Shift”* was used to describe the intense academic upheaval of the traditional historical norm. Thomas Kuhn’s belief that **historic scholarship represented the present beliefs of historians rather than built from a collective basis of past professional works.** The evolution of historagphy mirrored past efforts to expand to narrative of the every man, but now could utizle the modernization of information available to histroians. Historians attempted to bring new academic tools from social/scientific fields to further their own work *changing the examination of the past to fit current social dynamics, making history more relative to modern movements.* (P.130-4)

•	Naturally with the inclusion of marginalized histories and profound new ideas about linguistic study in academia caused reimagining of an established *“grand narrative”*. **History was infinitely more complex in its machinations with no two cultures exhibiting a total parallel.** *Historians attempted to tear down the notions of a singular image of a group, this left almost infinite room to examine the individual.* **The split structural narrative of various societies implicated an idea that individual and cultural development was shaped by the perceptions their own society.** Bordering on sociology, histories' place in academia became a blurred experiment in the modern cultural shift. (P.139)

•	Part of the expanding historical universe was the natural evolution into *”microhistory”*. This format of history took a step towards the Annales school ultimate goal of a total history. **By looking at individual minor actors in historical developments historians were able to create a larger and more telling recreation of events.** Further highlighting the actions of minor characters history fulfilled a people’s history telling the stories of working class citizens and their lives. (P.140) **Microhstory became one of the critical components of the histoical trends as historians could use a targeted approach to begin studies without needed a new historical category.** *Feminist, Linguistic, and Minority histories were able to easily grow from microhistory* without challenging a historical method. 

•	Following the movements of the 1970’s the second wave of Feminism exploded into the academic world. The female historical narrative also fell into a category that had been systemically ignored. **Female scholars like Natalie Zemon Davis and Gerda Lerner quickly expanded upon the forgotten half of the population’s part building humanity.** The impressive feminist catalog of historical work began to challenge the conceived notions of the past predicated on exemplifying the glories and follies of men alone.  (P.145) 

•	Further attempts to expand minority scholarship focused on finding groups that had been historically exempt from the Euro-centric success story of the western world. **The increased sensitivity to a homogenous world view drew saw old dangerous perspectives about marginalized groups brought to light and critisized.** These groups ranged from gender identities, to African and Asian cultures (p.149). 

•	History of memory style scholarship came into style by the works of Pierre Nora. *His style drew on early 20th century sociological methodology piecing together a nuanced view of a cultures identity.* Many elements of a groups past could be strung together to find the most important pieces of indentity i.e. art, food, music, scientific discorvy, and history itself. But, providing framework for individuals to glorify or exclude a nation’s worst moments can be a dangerous practice providing incentive for nationalistic movements (P.152) **However the history of memory approach also allowed for acceptance of oral histories as important cultural devices for a groups engagment with the past.** 

•	As historians grew apart from a unified style in history the profession underwent a crisis of identity. A global climate that was undergoing extreme political change led to a *”culture war”* over history. **Historians continue to struggle in finding a comfortable balance between easily accessible history and the chaotic landscape of professional academia.** In the United States this conflict has ensured that public perception of history is often left flawed at best. (P.150-63)

1. Added some clarifcation to bullets to include why they are important to larger historiographical context. I felt my summary was okay but could still use clearer phrasing when compared to others. 
2. Did some small rewrites to related to the clarification I needed because I write very confusing phrasing sometimes. Added more formatting with bolding and italicized phrases. 
3. Finally proofreading, there was a couple of mispelled words that I was able to find.
