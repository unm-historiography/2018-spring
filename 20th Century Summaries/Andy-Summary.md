### Summary

The United States and Western Europe gained unprecedented resources in higher education. Universities were rising, employment opportunities for historians increased, and colonies were eager to adopt Western models of scholarly inquiry, including those on historical research. (p. 127) Occurrences of labor movements and popular revolts within historical contexts came with demands of news ways of understanding the past. In the United States, **_C. Vann Woodward's_** *The Strange Career of Jim Crow (1955),* reflected the "revisionist" style of history, which depicted the reality of the lives of the poor and the oppressed.(p. 128) The perspective of "new history" spurred new historical methods and challenged the values of objectivity after 1945.

The generation of a *"people's history,"* although sometimes challenged, resulted in a permanent diversification of history curriculum. (p. 128) Vocal challenges opened up a new era of historiography, which included a multiplicity of new scholarly journals, including the *Journal of African History* and the first journal devoted exclusively to historiography in 1960, the *Journal Social History* in 1967, and the *Journal of Interdisciplinary History* in 1969.(p. 129) Many saw new historical methods as healthy diversity and others saw then as an abandonment of scholarly standards and the disappearance of "truth." (p. 129)

The shift in historical methods, including incorporating nontraditional sources, such as song of slaves and interviews with survivors of injustices, such as slavery and the Holocaust, which lead to the awareness of the development of meaningful cultures despite hegemonic domination.(p. 131) Attempts to create a "new social history" often linked history with the "hard sciences," such as economics, sociology, and demography; just as the **_Annales School_** historians of France had emphasized.(p. 132) The use of **_cliometrics_** a technique used to interpret history through statistical analysis of large-scale numerical data, assisted in the creation of a history of ordinary people's lives, which were often excluded and lacked documentation.(p. 133)

A new "paradigm shift" and "the linguistic turn" posited that the understanding of languages was the key to comprehension of the human experience.( p. 135) Among other things, the linguistic and cultural turns raised major questions about the relevance of the boundaries between academic disciplines.(p. 135) Historians **_Hayden White_** and **_Paul Ricoeur_** directed their attention to the linguistic nature of historical narratives and their status as cultural constructs, but both of them focused on the historiographical issue of the nature of the texts created by historians. (p. 137) French Philosopher **_Jean-Francois Lyotard_** wrote that cultural and economic changes in the world have made it impossible to cast history in the form of a "grand narrative," in which all developments were fitted into a coherent overall framework; such as the narratives provided by the *Enlightenment* and *Marxist* historical approaches.

French philosopher **_Michel Foucault_** emphasized that politics is not just exercised by governments and leaders, but it also exists in the form of *"micropolitics"* at the level of everyday life, which challenged the separation between social history, long-defined as "history with the politics left out" and political history. (p. 138) He also argues that historians are engaged in the exercise of power and that historians posses by virtue of their research, claims to power and authority. (p. 138)

The development of women's history from the 1960's to the 1980's was part of the "second wave" of feminism, which was seriously challenging the nature of institutions or the content of curricula, including those in history.(p. 143) Now, historians began insisting that not only women had the same right to study and teach history as men, but also that the definition of history had to be rethought in light of women's experiences. (p. 143)

The contestation of Eurocentrism was another was to challenge established ways of thinking about history. The literary critic **_Edward Said’s_** *Orientalism*, published in 1978, described European views of “Eastern” cultures, including academic historical scholarship, as “a Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient.”
 (p. 146)

The *history of memory* was another challenge to established historical norms and a historiographical consequence of the turn to cultural or interpretive history during the 1970's and 1980's, which is reflected during the "history wars" that later exploded in the later 1980's. French sociologist **_Maurice Halbwachs_** expressed that there is such a thing as collective memory, or a shared memory by the members of a given society, and that this memory alters over time. (p. 149) "Sites of memory," should also be incuded in the historical narrative, such as physical objects like the *palace of Versailles* and the *Eiffel Tower*, as well as, rituals such as the celebration of *Bastille Day.*
