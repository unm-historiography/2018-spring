- Historiography and the **methods** of understanding the past changed after World War II. As Popkin states, "In the United States and Western Europe, academic historians lived in societies that were investing unprecedented resources in higher education, and they largely shared a concensus about the poper methods for historical research." (p. 127) Therefore, previous methods like the _Rankean Model_ were deemed old fashioned and new methods aimed to understand history through **objectivity** calling students to **revisit** previous histories with new perspectives. Thus, students were able to study content that was relevant to their concerns and establish the academic setting things like seminars, student representation, and departmental commitees. (p.129) 

- 1960's and 70's historians drew on _Marxist_ and _Annales_ traditions by focusing on "the powerless, the inarticulate, and the poor" (p.130) the transformed **"social history"** aided in understanding the ongoing **marginalization of civil liberties**. This had a profound effect on African American history and campuses across the country which were being exposed to the experiences of those who lived it and not just those who wrote about it. As Popkin extrapolates, "Individual members of the lower class in the past rarely left much documentation about their lives, but by accumulating information on hundreds or thousands of people, historians could construct a group portrait that would offer insights into their experiences." (p. 131) Thus, a transition was occuring between **Macohistory to Microhistory.**  

- Advancing technologies like computers helped to compute the vast amounts of data being accumulated which concentrated on **demographic history** known as "cliometrics." (p. 131) A "third generation" of Annales historians developed which extensively troved through things like church records and census to find anwers to questions about people of the earlier centuries particularly life, death, and disease among the demographics. Understanding **trends** prompted research into these past populations and the conditions associated with them translated into the worries of the present. However, this **quantification** left historians reducing the people they studied to numbers leaving out the **human** aspect of their histories. (p. 133)   

- Popkin references Thomas Kuhn who felt that, "new ways of thinking about the past resulted from changes in historians' notion of how **individuals and societies** worked, and there might not be any single criterion by which historical truth could be defined." (p. 135) Linguistical work by Lynn Hunt and anthropological work by Clifford Geertz further aided the understanding that societies had their own **epistomoglogies**. This challenged earlier ideas of Eurocentrism and left great debates concerning **narrative truth**.  _Metahistory_ was now a  historiograph issue, "the nature of the texts, created by historians." (p.137)

- Ideas of "total history" were also changing as **Microhistory** used small scale stories to construct the past as opposed to Braudel's model of large scale socioeconomic factors.(p.140) This caused a "revisit" of historical works and suggested a new understanding in **"cultural perspective."**  In addition, implication of **ecological factors** were now being considered as historians like William Cronon examined **economic exploitation** particularly in American History. (p. 142) In doing so, this called to question historical/political **changes** while aiming to maintain the Micro aspect of "personal" histories.   

- Interest in **Feminsit History** also rose at this time. As Popkin states, "the growth of women's history was a collective process, carried out by participants in the feminist movement that began to develop in the radical atmosphere of the 1960s." (p. 142) This was linked to concerns over womens advancements in the workplace and their sexual exploitations by professors. Nonetheless, women influenced cultural history and the **agency** of those women was explored in what is dubbed the "second wave of feminism" and became a new model for historical scholarship. (p. 144) However, recognition for women continued to be a battle and in 1969, "women historians in the United States formed a _Cordinating Committee on Women in the Historical Profession_.  
 
- Focus in women's studies segwayed into understanding **gender** as a subject that had been long underviewed and which continues to be researched. Historian Michel Foucault and Joan Scott identified the cultural significance of gender. And as Popkin infers, "These theoretical perspectives helped to stimulate new research on the history of masculinity and the history of homosexuality." (p. 145) However, this raised questions regarding the women of various classes, ethnicities, and sexual orientation.
