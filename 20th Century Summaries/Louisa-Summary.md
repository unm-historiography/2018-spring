The Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s impacted how history students across the United States viewed, looked at, and wanted to learn history. They "demanded courses that were "relevant" because they spoke directly to the concerns of their own lives: classes on the history of Vietnam, to explain the origins of the war there, courses on the history of radical movements in the past, and on Africa and Latin America" (FHTH, p. 129). There was a call for a change in how and what history was taught. They wanted to understand how history played into the present. The students pushed for change that would help them to better understand their world and would lead to discussions on not only how history would be taught, but also in how historians wrote and thought about history. 

The attempts made to create a "new social history" (FHTH, p. 131) opened the study of history to "historical research in the use of quantitative data, which would give the discipline a more scientific character" (FHTH, p. 131). Incorporating quantitative data into the study of history gave new life to old statistics that would help to determine infant mortality rates, grain prices, ages at the time of marriage, among others. It would give historians a new form of evidence to utilize in their writings and new insights into the experiences of the past while it might not provide a complete picture of them.

"The new cultural history" (FHTH, p. 135) would give historians another avenue of sources and information to explore. This was a new approach to how to view history that was linked with the study of linguistics. Language was believed to be able to provide new details into the study of the past because language changes as the society changes. The cultural approach to the study of history would also put into question the idea of "Eurocentrism" and how historians would study different civilizations outside of the Western world.

Koselleck's, Begriffsgeschichte, observed "the eighteenth century saw a shift from references to "histories" in the plural to the notion of a single "history" involving all of mankind led him to argue that that period saw a fundamental shift in the way in which people understood the relationship between the past, the present, and the future" (FHTH, p. 139). There was a shift from understanding history through the eyes of the elites to understanding history through the eyes of the lower classes, which the Annales considered to be the "third level" of historical reality. It appears that the cultural approach to the study of history was undergoing a shift that would ultimately change how history would be interpreted, viewed, and accepted. 

"The history of everyday life was closely linked to a new genre that developed out of the movement to cultural history and came to be known as "microhistory"â€¦Microhistorians use these small-scale stories to construct a kind of "total history" different from the grand tableaux of social historians such as Fernand Braudel, bringing together the different aspects of their subjects' lives to show how a single incident can illuminate much broader aspects of the culture and society of the past" (FHTH, p. 140). This is significant because while it opens a new door for exploration in the field of history, it questioned the tradition of explaining past life through the social structures/classes. It gave new meaning to specific events and their effects on the society they happened in. It would give more meaning to the smaller historic details which would possibly help illuminate the bigger picture.

The movement of Feminism changed the historical profession in many ways. It opened the doors for women to enter the profession and it created a new lens to look through when studying history. "The rise of women's history thus affected not only the content of historical studies, but also the substance of historians' careers and the nature of interactions between students and teachers" (FHTH, p. 142-143). Although, since women hadn't played big political roles in the past, their cultural and everyday life roles were seen as "supplemental" (FHTH, p. 144) compared to the political and economic histories of particular areas. The Feminism Movement had "profoundly changed the historical profession and the content of scholarships" (FHTH, p. 146).

Marshall Sahlins argued that "different cultural orders have their own modes of historical action, consciousness, and determination - their own historical practice" (FHTH, p. 146). This not only challenged the idea of "Eurocentrism" but also called out historians for their personal biases in their writings. Different cultures develop and interact differently, so each culture needs to be studied on its own (although, comparative studies between cultures can provide lots of information). It placed importance on understanding a culture in the way that they themselves understand themselves. It would lead historians from approaching all cultures (Western or not) with the understanding that its different from others.

Maurice Halbwachs put forth the idea "that there is such a thing as a collective memory, shared by the members of a given society, and that this memory alters over time - in other words, that is has its own history" (FHTH, p. 149). This idea is significant because it puts into perspective that how a society views an event or a particular part of history, is in of itself, history. The collective memory that a society obtains can give historians insights into how the public views the events of history. While an event/idea/policy might have meant to impact life in one way, it might have been taken differently by the population. It is important to remain skeptical and to ask questions, but it does bring history down from the level of a profession to the public level where it can be shared by everyone.
