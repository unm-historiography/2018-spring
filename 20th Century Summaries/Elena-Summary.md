* **The 1960s saw a dramatic change in Western historical methods.** Disillusionment brought on by the Vietnam War and the rise of the Civil Rights Movement led to college students seeking **history courses that examined topics “relevant” to current events.** This then led to history becoming much **more diversified, analyzing the contributions of women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other “poor and oppressed” peoples** (p. 127-130).


* Another form of history that developed during the 1960s and 1970s was **“cliometrics,” also known as “quantitative history.”**  By studying census data and other sources (such as “church records of baptisms, marriages, and burials”), historians could gather **statistical information about the demography of different regions in different times.** This **contrasted with earlier historical models which sought to reconstruct past societies using “evidence from literary texts.”** While the cliometric model **created a more accurate picture of how long people lived, it did not explain how they lived.** Such data was also subject to **“detailed discussions of the problems of source interpretation” that proved unengaging to researchers and readers alike (p. 131-133).


* Historian **Lynn Hunt’s book *Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution* (1984) took two different approaches to the topic. The first half** (which was actually written second) **analyzed the language and culture of the time while the second half was written with a quantitative historical approach.** The book **represented the “paradigm shift” of history in the 1970s, or “the linguistic turn,” which states that “the understanding of language was the key to the comprehension of human experience”.** **This paradigm shift served as another example of history interconnecting with other disciplines** (p. 133-135). 


* During the 1970s, **the Annales school and a group of Italian scholars were developing a “history of everyday life”** (as the former called it) **or “microhistory”** (as the latter called it). These new models spotlighted “every aspect of ordinary life, including food, clothing, and family relations.” **The history of everyday life expanded on the Annalistes goal of breaking from political history to a model that more closely examined society.** As for microhistory, it **“allowed historians to argue for the agency of ordinary people, rather than seeing them as prisoners of the large social structures that had figured in the work of Fernand Braudel”** (p. 139-140).


* **The rise of “second wave” feminism (the 1960s through the 1980s) led to the development of women’s history.** Not only were **more historical narratives including women, but more women were gaining influence and employment opportunities in history departments at universities.** Subsequently, feminism experienced a **“third wave”** where the movement and women’s history alike would have to include **women of color, poor women, and LGBTQ+ women (both the movement and the field had received criticism for focusing on middle-class white women)** (p. 142-146).


* **Historical narratives (starting in the 1970s) sought to break from the Eurocentric model and focus on the world beyond the West.** As opposed to depicting non-Western societies as “static and unchanging until they were acted on by outside forces,” **this new model utilized the sources from these very societies and addressing how Western historiography “enabled European domination of the world in the nineteenth century”** (p. 146-149).


* **The 1980s saw the development of the “history of memory,”** which relied on the testimony of people who lived through events (such as Holocaust survivors and former slaves). **These testimonies allowed for oral history to be “employed as evidence even in writing about events for which copious printed sources existed,” as opposed to being only valuable “when other forms of documentation were unavailable.”** However, critics have stated that **“individual memory can be fallible or confused,”** especially when it comes to events that happened years or even decades prior (p. 151). 


* **The “history wars” of the 1980s were centered around “heated debate[s] … about the interpretation of history.”** Notable examples include **Germany and how historians approached “the country’s collective responsibility for the events of the Holocaust,”** **former Communist bloc countries’ attempts to write truthfully about the former Soviet Union,** and the **conflicts in the United States** about how to address parts of the country’s past that on one hand should be condemned and on the other should be celebrated. **While these “wars” did cause fear in many a scholar** (notably Francis Fukuyama who announced “the end of history”), **they did also “demonstrate how much the past still matters in our culture”** (p. 153-162).


* I was still satisfied with the information I chose to summarize and my sentence structure, but I decided to bold my major points since each of my bullet points contained a decent amount of information.
