## 20th Century History Summary 
Jerome T. Mondragon

- The Cold War was in full effect during the 1960s. Many history genres emerged as the general public demanded that history reflect neglected demographs. One such genre was Microhistory which focused on specific incidents created by ordinary people. (Popkin 140) However, historians worried that governments, leaders, and ideologies would be forgotten in history. (Popkin 142)

- __The Cold War ended as the Soviet Union collapsed__ during later part of the 20th Century. Historians now had access to archives and other historical resources which have been restricted for decades. Local historians can now interpret history without overbearing censorship of the government. (Popkin 158-159)

- Following the Second World War, many former colonies of world superpowers began contesting the __"Eurocentrism"__ view of their own history. European evalution of other countries history reflect a Western perspective. Many countries and cultures had their own methods of presenting their history including art, culture, and languages. For example, many African cultures emphasized oral history in reconstucting their past which reflected a distinct version of their history. (Popkin 146-148)

- There were __significant changes of the teaching of history in universities__. After WWII, more people were attending college. During the 1960s, students demanded and often designed courses that reflected their race, culture, gender, and social status. Students could also evaluated their courses and the instuctors who taught them. These new teaching methods challenged the credibility of courses and opened the door to history revision and "politic correctness" of history. (Popkin 127-129)
  
- The "second wave" of __feminism__ occured during the seconds half of the 20th Century. This movement initiated a renewed interest in women in history. This movement also resulted in social improvements for women including protection from sexual harrasment and sexual exploitation in the work place. There was also an increase of female history instuctors which was mostly dominated by men. (Popkin 142-144)

- Many historians disagreed with the ideologies and practices of history which became known as the __"History Wars."__ The culture wars were the disagreements of interpretation of the past in different countries. One notable example is known as the "Battle of the Historians" in which the Holocaust was reinterpreted by Germany. Other countries accused Germany of denying responsibility for the event. Lastly, "Afrocentrism" contested the neglected black African contributions of history. (Popkin 153-162)

- Another challenge to history during the 1980s was the issue of collective memory. The benifits of memory were the first-person accounts of events and subjects' emotional experiences. The problem is that __memory is fallable!__ Also, memory can drastically change over time. Historians were professionally trained to evaluate sources rather than relying on their personal memory. 

- Western countries also relied on __collective memory to interpret history__. Rather than relying on historians, countries created museums, historical sites, monuments, and even theme parks to reconstruct their past and create a new national identity. (Popkin 149)
