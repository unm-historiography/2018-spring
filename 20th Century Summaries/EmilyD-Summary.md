# Hippies for Historical Revolution
## A Summary

1. The revolutionary change of historical study is tied directly to *actual revolution* in much of the world---or at very least social uprisings throughout the post-war period of the 1960s (Popkin, pg. 128). With development of many African countries, the beginning of the Cold War, and the uprising for political change in China the world was at a "turning point." The historiographical changes that occured during this period best illustrates this **change in the way of thinking** of both historian and the general populace.
2. One of the main locations of discourse were college campuses, debating for the changing view of history (Popkin, pg. 129). As "radical" ideas on social constructs began to make their way across the U.S., college students and professors saw it as a chance to **completely alter the academic world**. Students wanted "relevant" history courses that focused on the “people’s history”. It was both the explosion of degree seeking students, and the radical world changes, that initiated this incredible influx of course ideas and varieties.
3. The sociological point of view was a major factor for the shift within the historiographical world, as  the “**people’s history**” gained more popularity in research topics. Now, after the "revolution," instead of looking at the kings, clergy, and elites of a society historians were studying the lives and struggles of the common man (Popkin, pg. 130). This social history also focused on traditionally marginalized groups within society. Everyone including women, people of color, colonized populations, LGBT folks---anyone who had not traditionally held powerful positions---were now all a part of historical cirriculum.
4. A paradigm shift also occured in this period in the conception of "**historical truth**." Historical truth was redefined during this time; not being seen as a constant, but rather a function of the beliefs of the society (Popkin, pg. 134-35). The two historians credited with this discovery, Thomas Kuhn and Lynn Hunt, developed an *actual answer* to the questions that had been asked throughout all of history. 
5. The rise in the inclusion of of women’s narrative, thanks to second wave feminism, became a popular practice during this period. The inclusion of women came about for two reasons: **greater independence** and **job opportunities** in academia. Women were beginning to find roles outside of the home, giving them economic independence. While the boom in college students, and access to college meant they could get jobs teaching about the independence they had gained---and who made it possible---by creating historical cirriculum around first wave feminism, and the struggles of women that came before them (Popkin, pg. 143). 
6. With the decolonization of Africa, and history of histories written from a single perspective, a general **distaste for Eurocenterism**  in politics and history developed. With a new view of imperialism, and its many detrimental elements, many historians wanted to make the public “conscious of non-Western historical perspectives” (Popkin, pg. 146). adjusting and healing the imbalance of a Western focused history, by including the histories that encompassed the rest of the world, was one approach that historians took to turn away from Eurocentric histories. The bad reputation and terrible "face" of imperialism that emerged from the conficts of World War II was enough to drive away even many Americans from traditional views on imperialism---people that gained the most from imperialism to begin with---inspiring the rising popularity of non-Western cultures/civilizations in studies.
7. The idea of a **collective memory** arose during this time period creating a population of people that are often far less interested in the truth than with a familiar narrative (Popkin, pg. 149). This ideology suggests that all the members of the society have a shared memory, or a history, of their society and its interests. This collective memory was especially powerful surrounding traumatic events, like war.  The debates and discussions regarding this "memory" leads to the creation of a strong cultural identity, which can be corrupted by misguided narratives within such discussions, or to what extent a narrative is tre (Popkin, 154-58).
