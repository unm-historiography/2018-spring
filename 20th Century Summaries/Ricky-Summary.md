## 20th Century Overview

### Summary

- The political and social tension of the 1960’s garnered support for the history of the poor and oppressed in the United States (Popkin, p. 128). This required new methods, and students demanded relevant courses to address this (p. 129). This emphasis on a **new area** of historical work emanates ideals of the Annales school. However, it also reveals larger changes in American society and culture that paralleled these new historical methodologies. 

- The invention and innovation of computers allowed for larger and more precise quantitative work in history to occur in the later 20th century (p. 131). Coupled with an emphasis on statistics, historical work based on large-scale economic data known as “cliometrics” came into use. While quantitative history had its role in studying basic data in life, it had shortcomings in the **personal and social experience of the world**, it could not analyze data that could not be sorted. 

- A massive shift in historiographical work came about as a result of the *linguistic turn* (p. 135). To emphasize the importance of narrative in history and how historians shape these **visions of history** is topic of major importance in an age where historical methods are quick to contradict one another. This adherence to rhetoric was a departure from the Annales standard of social factors and other popular historical methods of the 20th century, such as quantitative analysis.

- The massive amount of differentiating historical methodology and **ideals coming from the later 20th century naturally encouraged division among historians**. These “history wars”, which not only included arguments about methodology, but also of the truth in sources and prior histories of the past made historians deadlock in an argument that is still alive today (p. 158, 162). One can see these *wars* emanate into modern history, such as the interpretation of past wars in the United States. While **arguing about historical methodology is not a new concept (as seen by the opposition to Ranke, the Annales, and Marx), the sheer volume of new methods ensured a debate** would spark. 

- This grand adoption of a *linguistic change* in historical works decreased trust in the ability to construct a **total history** or a *grand narrative* (p. 137). As such, methodologies stemming from this, such as Marxism and the Enlightenment ideal of evolving society **garnered much more criticism**. Historians were wary to justify their arguments in this way, a stark contrast from the Annales concept of utilizing social histories to gain an idea of this *total history*. 

- With a *linguistic turn* of historical ideals, it is natural for there to be an increase in the history of women in the way it expanded in the later 20th century (p. 142). Microhistory also contributed to this increase in popularity of women's history (p. 143). Some argued that modern history necessitated a *paradigm shift* to properly include women in historical accounts, much akin to the larger linguistic turn. **Historians now looked for women’s rights innovations and cultural changes in histories that were already intensely deconstructed** in the *non-linguistic* sense, such as the Renaissance. 

- Historians became more concerned with how they were relating sources to largely European and American views (p. 146). Eurocentrism was found deeply rooted in historiography, with most historians assuming a *cause-and-effect* relationship of Europe affecting the rest of the worlds histories. In effort to combat this, **historians had to be careful not to evaluate histories under western virtues**, as African oral histories might not hold up to the standards set by western historiography but **can contain valuable information on par with written record of the time**. The way historians look down on non-western historical methods has also contributed to this Euro-centrist view.

- Paralleled alongside the rise in the interest of history and historical accounts came the “history of memory.” (p. 149, 151). This entailed utilizing a *collective memory* of a society to see how the society is, and how it can change. These memories aren’t just individual’s thoughts, they can also be *mementos* left behind, such as flags, buildings, and even rituals (p. 150). This increased the source pool for historians yet again and warmed up historian’s thoughts to the legitimacy of oral history. This idea would have been ridiculed by Ranke and the followers of the scientific approach to historical work in the late 19th century, but **the linguistic turn expanded what constitutes a verified source, and these new applications allowed for *memories* to be a part of history**. 

### Changes:

- Added detail to points 1, 3, and 8, which I felt lacked the proper background. 

- Cleaned up point 4, shifted reasoning for the point to be about the "history wars", which I felt was an important part of this reading (and displays the whirlwing of methodologies we will be discussing over the next weeks). 

- Increased formatting in bolding, italics, general word flow.
