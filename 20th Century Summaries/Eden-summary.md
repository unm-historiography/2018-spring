# Historiography during 20th century 

1. After WWII, more history students demanded to learn "relevant" histories. (Popkin, p. 129) This challenged the traditional Ranke pedagogy of history and created radical movements to change the way history was taught. 

2. In the early 1970s, the "new history movement" tried to make history **linked** to the "harder" social sciences such as economics and sociology. This period of time also began the historical use of *quantitative data* which was analyzed with a new technology, computers, which revolutionized the way this data was analyzed. (Popkin, p.131)

3. A challenge that appeared during this time was whether or not Western frameworks *could be applied to other parts* of the world. A movement for postcolonial history over a "Eurocentric" version of history was a model to which "other parts of the world needed to conform" (Popkin, p. 135). 

4. Cultural history's importance from the Annales historians remained the "third level" which is "connected to a basic foundation defined by demographic and economic conditions and...social institutions" (Popkin, p. 139). This is important in the development of microhistory. 

**5**. Poststructuralist history believes "multiple and sometimes mutually exclusive interpretations [are] possible and inevitable, and the truth of an interpretation cannot be verified" (Green & Troup, p. 300). This means that all versions of history/histories are equally representative of reality and therefore *equally fictitious*. This is an important reality within the study of history because there is no way to truly determine the truth. 

6. Microhistory, developed by a group of scholars, focused on "a concentration of specific events, narrowly limited in time and space, and *usually involving otherwise unknown minor figures*" (Popkin, p. 140). This allowed historians to give humans of the past agency, instead of assuming Braudel's theory of social structures being the *only* influence of past humans. 

7. During this time period, women's history also became legitimized by microhistories and cultural histories. (Popkin, p. 143) This was detailed in Foucault's *History of Sexuality* which stated that gender identities are formed by culturally constructed institutions (Popkin, p. 145). This was a **foundational** movement in the 1970s, which formed the scholarship of sexual minorities. 

8. Eurocentrism was contested continuously throughout this time period with the "questioning European perspectives on the non-European past" and was the critique of Edward Said's book *Orientalism*. This was an important contribution to Western scholarship because it questioned the sources that were used to write history and the methods within Western-centralized histories (Popkin, p. 149). 

9. The history of memory increased the interest in memory and witness testimony. Implemented by French historian Pierre Nora in 1982, the history of memory argued for oral history and the recollection of events and the **importance** of an oral record. (Popkin, p. 152) This is important because prior to this, oral histories were not seen as legitimate. 

10. There was a strong shift in the latter part of the 20th century which *demanded historical narratives* be told with **identifiable heroes and villains**. (Popkin, p. 156) This is problematic because it is a very narrow view of the historical past.
