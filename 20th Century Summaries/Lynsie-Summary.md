### Glorious Confusion Summary

- Historical scholarship in **the 1960s experienced both confidence for the future of the field and a "challenge to the unity of the discipline"** when new methodological approaches and questions emerged (p 127). Inspired by Marxist theories, these historians focused on the history of "the powerless, the inarticulate, the poor" and previously ignored histories, such as slavery in the United States (p 130).

- **Historical pedagogy changed significantly during the 1960s and was driven by the students.** Students on college campuses demanded courses that were "relevant" to the concerns in their lives, such as classes on the history of Vietnam and the history of minorities. Innovations of the 1960s resulted in a permanent **diversification of history curricula** and institutionalized student involvement in departments and course evaluations (p 129).

- New research methods involving **quantitative data** were introduced to create a "new social history" know as **"cliometrics"**. These historians wanted to link history with the "hard" social sciences to "give the discipline a more scientific character" (p 131). The theory behind this methodology was that by accumulating data on hundreds of people within the lower classes during a particular period, historians could create a "group portrait" (p 131).  While the data produced impressive results, historians critiqued the methods because it ultimately **"reduced the people they wanted to study to a collection of numbers"** (p 132-133).

- Lynn Hunt's book _Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution_ showed in one piece the **paradigm shift that was occurring both in academia and history** during the 1970s (p 134). Thomas Kuhn, who coined the phrase "paradigm shift," believed the success of new theories and methods was not because they were "truer" than ones of the past, but because the majority of professionals in a field were using them (p 134-135). Historians were **moving away from cliometric and quantitative research in favor of language and rhetorical analysis**. This shift later became known as **"the linguistic turn"** (p 135).

- The paradigm shift and linguistic turn were closely associated with the rise of **"new cultural history"** which challenged long-held assumptions about our world. The importance of language was central to many historian's works, such as **Michel Foucault** and his notion of **discourse** as well as J.G. A. Pocock. This work was closely related to the Annanels School and the concept of "mentalities" (p 137-139) popular in the 1970s.

- **Women's history and gender relations** dramatically increased with the rise of linguistic and cultural history. Pioneering women's historians were greatly influenced by **Simone de Beauvoir** and **Betty Friedan**, who was instrumental to "second-wave feminism" who challenged women's position within society (p 142). As women were traditionally excluded from positions of power, **the rise of cultural history made it possible to feature women in a way that had not been possible with political history** (p 143). Despite the new and unknown areas of research to explore, many female historians were still excluded from their profession, and women's historians argued historiography often marginalized women and their contribution to the past (p 144-145). Michel Foucault's unfinished **_History of the Sexes_** provided a **framework for gender studies** and research on the history of homosexuality, lesbianism, and queer studies (p 145).  

- Eurocentrism was challenged most notably by the literary critic, **Edward Said** and his book _Orientalism_. Said argued that **"Orientalism had denied non-European societies any real history of their own**, positing instead that changes in them were 'mere responses to the West'"(p 146). Questioning this perspective requires us to recognize that other non-Western societies have their ways of representing the past that is equally as valid as Western representations (p 146). An issue raised in the attempt to rectify and encourage non-Eurocentric histories was the use of non-traditional sources such as oral histories in Africa, or annals in India and its validity as a reliable source (p 147).   

- The impact **collective memory** plays on history, first posited by Maurice Halbwachs, was revived and became a major inspiration and growing interest for historians. Paul Fussel argued that **memory needs to understood as a historical force** (p 149). French historian, Pierre Nora, used the concept of historical memory to approach historiography and French culture (p 149). His project, **_Les lieux de m√©moire_, or Memory Sites,** connected various cultural objects to collective memories, building a more cohesive French identity. Nora's memory sites could range from physical objects, rituals, and symbols to mental concepts (p 150). The awareness of historical memory coincided with the **growing interest of eyewitness testimonies of historical events**, such as survivors of the Holocaust like Elie Wiesel, and the publicized hearings at the end of the South African apartheid regime (p 151). The increased interest in memory and eyewitness accounts helped legitimize oral history as a source for historians (p 151).  

- **"History Wars"** during the 1980s and 1990s affected many different countries and were between many different parties. Some historians were very concerned over the inclusion of women and minoritiesm, with historian Peter Novick concluding that **"the discipline of history had ceased to exist"** (p 153). Popkin argues that because the general public was slow to accept the multiplicity of new perspectives in history, it set the stage for **"culture wars" regarding the interpretation of history** (p 156). Versions of these "wars" were seen in the US, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, all centering around the arguments of historical memory, politics, and cultural identity (p 156-162).
