- Civil unrest during the 1960s drove a desire for **"new history"** that expanded beyond the bounds of previous methodologies. Particularly of interest, was the history of the lives of the poor and oppressed. This led to innovations which resulted in more diverse historical curricula and increases in student representation on departmental committees. **This is important as it institutuionalized a shift in the field of history to now include these priorly excluded groups in the study of history.** There are critics however, who warn that too much revisionism could lead to highjacking of history to support individual agendas or a rise in authoritarian "political correctness" in the field. (Popkin pp.128-130)
- **Technological advancement in the 20th century led to a surge in newly possible methods of studying historical evidence.** One of the major methods to emerge as a result was the use of quantitative data. This allowed scholars to examine vast amounts of information from people from lower classes in order to draw larger pictures of these groups as a way of getting insights into their experiences. **This is an important advancement and methodology that was not as possible or easily done before these technological advances became available to historians.** A potential problem that arose from this method was that it often dehumanized the subjects of study and became more of a study of numbers than humanity.(Popkin pp.131-133)
- In the 1980s, **Lynn Hunt** published an influential book titled *Politics, Culture, and Class* in the French Revolution which offered a new shift in historiographic thought. **She asserted that linguistic and cultural turns had changed her view on what was historically relevant or should be prioritized as a central focus for historical study.** During the course of her book she switched her methodology from a quantitative research approach to one focused more on analysis of language and art. **The main question Hunt would pose is, whether or not these two methods of analyzing history were compatible or not.** Lynn's book would later be closely related to what would be known as "the new cultural history."(Popkin pp. 133-135)
- **Hayden White's** 1973 book, *Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe*, challenged that "historical works are not transparent reflections of the facts about the past but are instead literary texts, not easily distinguishable from fiction," and that **the context and narrative a historian assigns to historical events reflects their own presuppositions and biases rather than the historical evidence it is reliant on.** He supported this argument by stating that historians disagree with one another on the same events, and their willingness to agree on something hinges on it suiting their own agenda.(Popkin p. 136)
- **Microhistory**, which uses small-scale stories to create a broader picture and **"total history" by bringing in more minor figures to argue for the agency of ordinary people** emerges in the 1970's as an offshoot of the cultural history movement. This was an important new way to gain alternative perspectives of historical events. (Popkin pp. 140-141)
- **Women's history and the history of gender relations** also coincide with the boom in linguistic and cultural approaches to history. The growth of women's history was a collaborative process of participants in the feminist movement that developed in the 1960s as a response to concerns about current job and academic opportunity for women. **The aforementioned techniques of microhistory became a valuable tool as a method to study the agency of women in past eras.**(Popkin pp. 142-143)
- Another key challenge to historical practice came in the form of allegations of **eurocentrism.** This claim **argued that Western historians had based all of the non-western world in a secondary role to europeans and that these histories are often only told through a euopean perspective that is overly dismissive of these other culture's own histories or methods of recording their own histories**. Some historians warned that while this notion is important and it is important for western historians to be conscious of this tendency, we also cannot throw out all of western history with the proverbial bath water. (Popkin pp. 146-149)
- Another new concept to emerge in the twentieth century is the **history of memory. this asserts the idea that there is a shared collective memory within societies, which like individual memory, can shift and change over time.** This has coincided with an increased attention to witnesses and survivors of historic events. Notably, the holocaust and other tragic events. This reliance on witnesses and victims and dismisal of historians can be problematic. On the one hand historians typically were not present for the events they are researching, on the other hand individual memory of events can be fallible as well. (Popkin pp. 149-151)
- **The 1980s and 1990s saw Americans interest in the past increasingly shaped by popular media.** This proved problemtic for historians as popular media is not beholden to the same virtues that govern the field of history. Some historians did acknowledge the positive aspects of these adaptations of history, but they also had to contend with these versions **challenging popularly accepted narratives of history, or even shaping new ones.** (Popkin pp. 153-156)
