The Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s impacted how history students across the United States viewed, looked at, and wanted to learn history. They "demanded courses that were "relevant" because they spoke directly to the concerns of their own lives: classes on the history of Vietnam, to explain the origins of the war there, courses on the history of radical movements in the past, and on Africa and Latin America" (FHTH, p. 129). **There was a call for a change in how students wanted to approach history.** They wanted to understand how history played into the present. The students pushed for change, not historians or the professors, that would help them to better understand their world and would lead to discussions with professors and students about how history could be taught at the university level. 

The attempts made to create a "new social history" (FHTH, p. 131) opened the study of history to *"historical research in the use of quantitative data, which would give the discipline a more scientific character"* (FHTH, p. 131). Incorporating quantitative data into the study of history gave new life to old statistics that would help to determine infant mortality rates, grain prices, ages at the time of marriage, among others. **Quantitative data gave historians a new form of evidence to utilize in their writings and new insights into the experiences of the past while it might not provide a complete picture of them.**

"The new cultural history" (FHTH, p. 135) would give historians another avenue of sources and information to explore. **This was a new approach to how to view history that was linked with the study of linguistics.** Language was believed to be able to provide new details into the study of the past since it was a central part of a society and how they interact with one another and with other societies. It can also illuminate changes that occurred in that society because the language would evolve as that society did. **The cultural approach to the study of history would also put into question the idea of "Eurocentrism" and how historians would study different civilizations, such as Non-Western civilizations.**

Koselleck's, *Begriffsgeschichte*, observed "the eighteenth century saw a shift from references to "histories" in the plural to the notion of a single "history" involving all of mankind led him to argue that that period saw a fundamental shift in the way in which people understood the relationship between the past, the present, and the future" (FHTH, p. 139). **There was a shift from studying history through the eyes of the elites to studying history through the eyes of the lower classes**, which the Annales considered to be the "third level" of historical reality. It appears that the cultural approach to the study of history was undergoing a shift that would impacted historical studies in new ways, with new evidence, and new forms of sources. 

"Microhistorians use these small-scale stories to construct a kind of "total history" different from the grand tableaux of social historians such as Fernand Braudel, bringing together the different aspects of their subjects' lives to show how a single incident can illuminate much broader aspects of the culture and society of the past" (FHTH, p. 140). **This is significant because microhistory not only opened a new door for exploration in the field of history, it also questioned the tradition of explaining past life through the social structures/classes, and gave new meaning to specific events and the effects on the society they happened in.** It would give more meaning to the smaller historic details which would possibly help illuminate the bigger picture.

The movement of Feminism changed the historical profession in many ways. It opened the doors for women to enter the profession and it created a new lens to look through when studying history. **Allowing women to enter the profession, also brought with it a new focus on the study of women's history. Taking women from a *"supplemental"* (FHTH, p. 144) role to a mainstream historical focus.** Fitting into the microhistory model of understanding how women impacted and helped the develop of the society around them.

**Different cultures develop and interact differently, so each culture needs to be studied on its own (although, comparative studies between cultures can provide lots of information). It placed importance on understanding a culture in the way that they themselves understand themselves.** Marshall Sahlins stated, "different cultural orders have their own modes of historical action, consciousness, and determination - their own historical practice" (FHTH, p. 146). This not only challenged the idea of "Eurocentrism" but also called out historians for their personal biases in their writings.  It would lead historians from approaching all cultures (Western or not) with the understanding that its different from others.

Maurice Halbwachs put forth the idea "that there is such a thing as a collective memory, shared by the members of a given society, and that this memory alters over time - in other words, that is has its own history" (FHTH, p. 149). **This idea is significant because it puts into perspective that how a society views an event or a particular part of history, is in of itself, history.** The collective memory that a society obtains can give historians insights into how the public views the events of history. While an event/idea/policy might have meant to impact life in one way, it might have been taken differently by the population. It is important to remain skeptical and to ask questions, but it does bring history down from the level of a profession to the public level where it can be shared by everyone. 


The first change I made during my revisions was ensuring that I bolded important sentences/phrases that encompassed the significance and the topic of each paragraph. It's important that the most vital sentence of my summary was the one that stood out from the rest. 
The second change I made during my revisions was another round of proofreading. I found some minor mistakes in grammar and my sentence structures that I worked to clear up. It seemed to help with the flow of some of my bulletpoints while also allowing me to condense some of the longer bulletpoints that had been dragged on. 
The third change I made during my revisions was removing two of the quotes in bulletpoint 6 since the paragraph was basically all quotes. I replaced two of the quotes with more assessment in the significance of the quote that stood out most to me during my reading of the Feminist Movement. I hadn't realized how I hadn't explained the significance of women entering the history profession in my first summary.
