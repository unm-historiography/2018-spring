# **The historiographical Revolution of the 60s**
* One of the drivers of the change in historiographical method in the 1960s was of course a radically changing world landscape. **A Social revolution among students as well as the rise of the cold war and the civil rights movement in the USA shows that many changes in historical method mirrored changes found in larger society**. *Another critical component of the 1960s was the breakdown of colonial empires and the rise of many newly independent nations around the world* (Popkin 128)
* Historians like Lynn Hunt who began to use the "linguistic turn" within historiography radically changed precedents that had been set by the Annales school. **The idea that the study of rhetoric and how discourse played out directly within the past was a revolutionary shift from the social science and quantative methodology that had been popularized by the Annales** (Popkin 133-135)
* While extremely controversial, Hayden White's *Metahistory* is nonetheless a critical critique of historical method. While White's postulations that a historian was more of an author interpreting events in a narrative that could never be factually "correct" has many damaging effects in the discipline of history it also has uses. **White's work inspired historians to be more careful in how they presented their accounts and it gave way to new genres of entirely narrativized histories which have importance in the way that history is relatable and interesting to a modern reader.** (Popkin 135-136)
* The French philosophers and historians Jean-Francois Lyotard and Michel Foucault's works provided us with a extremely important revolution in historical thinking which was the death of the 'grand narrative'. **The idea of no overarching march towards a "more ideal civilization and world" is so important now that we take it for granted in Historical academia even though many Americans and westerners still buy into it.** It completely turns previous ideological schools such as enlightenment thinking and Marxist historiography on their heads and gives research a more globalistic approach. (Popkin 137)
* An absolutely critical shift in the 1960s which still has momentum today in the field is a new interest and focus on the history of women. The re consideration of women's contributions and places within history is critical to any and all meaningful historical revisionism. *Historians like Joan Kelly-Gadol are just one example of how fundamental the consideration of women's experience can be to re-writing history for example her objection to the title "the renaissance" as the time was hardly a renaissance for Italian women.* **Other Historians like Foucault demonstrate the revolution in how we acknowledge gender as a cultural construct rather than biological inevitability which is an idea that continues to be relevant today. Women's history can be seen as a natural compliment to the rise of social and linguistic history as well as new methodology in how sources are selected, discovered and integrated.** (Popkin 129-131, 142-145)
* Hand in hand with a new found interest and re orientation of the importance of women in the historical narrative was also the rise of examining and reframing the eurocentrism that had dominated western intellectualism for centuries. **Historians such as Dipesh Chakrabarty and Richard Price among others sought to reframe fundamental views about the non western world which centered around those cultures simply reacting to western imperialism as their main modus of change as well as the general ignorance of western historians of these cultures' own historical traditions.** This along with gender history are still perhaps the 2 most hotly debated subjects in history. Questions such as if western historians are even equipped to understand the history of other cultures are still trying to be answered today. (Popkin 129-131, 146-148)
* As a result of the varied revisionist elements of 1960s historiography another critical question came into view which was the history of memory and the idea of a collective memory. This idea is extremely relevant to modern historians and is an **integral part in how we view the impacts of national identity and how that relates to physical places or events as well as what the lasting consequences of events such as the holocaust or American slavery have on people who did not live through them but belong to the descendent group of the victimized.** (Popkin 149-153)
* Finally, another aspect like the idea of collective memory which resulted out of the revisionism of the 60s was the so called "history wars". This concept is one that is alive and well today as inevitably any revision to history will have push back. Conservative historians have been grappling for decades to uphold the comfortable narratives of the past while historians of the revisionist camp fight for the narrative to change in a more inclusive and critical view of the past. *The battles over what constitute good sources, methodology and assertions of the past are still fresh today and have no semblance of dying down. Ideas such as White's Metahistory, the concept of collective memory, the rejection of the grand narrative and the rise of feminism and the denouncement of eurocentrism as well as the modern consequence of globalism have all melded to fuel these debates even more intensely.* **Perhaps the most important takeaway from the historiographical revolution of the 1960s is that historical method became more varied in its schools of thought and the types of history that historians became interested with than ever before. Methods of gathering data and writing history as a whole were fundamentally changed and thus what we consider modern historiography was born. This all coming on the framework made by early modern historians such as the Annales school whose change in method as well as increased interest in the common people can be seen as a clear precursor to what was to come in the 1960s.** (Popkin 154-162)
