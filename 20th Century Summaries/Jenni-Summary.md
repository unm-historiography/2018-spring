## Key Shifts in the Study of History in the Second Half of the 1900s

-	In the 1960s, students at universities began _demanding classes in history that more directly applied to their own lives_, leading to the offering of college courses exploring **recent history**, like the Vietnam War, and **radical history**, in which radical movements created by minority figures in the past were examined. It also lead to the idea that there could be **multiple interpretations of events by introducing differing perspectives** as viable evidence, whereas the popular view of history had previously been that there could only be one correct interpretation, and colleges had taught more traditional history courses that was less focused on "the people" than it had been on events **(p. 129)**.
-	 **Radical historians** focused on studying the **history of the marginalized and the oppressed**, rather than the history of the people in _power_. These historians used **non-traditional sources** to find evidence for their history because most **previous historians** had _ignored_ these groups and the people in power had tried to _erase_ the "traditional" types of evidence historians typically used. Instead, they turned to **Annales school-style evidence: economic, sociological, and demographic evidence (130-1)**.
-	The **paradigm shift** in the mid 1980s moved the **study of history** from focusing on **"hard" evidence and perfecting research** to a focus on how **new ways of thinking about the past could be created from studying how individuals and societies worked**- showing that there are _multiple_ ways to look at history _simultaneously_, and **no one can demonstrate what historical "truth" is any more true than the others**, and the differences between them are instead more **moral or aesthetic** than anything else **(p. 135-6)**.
-	 **Foucault** introduced the idea that **social and political history are intertwined**, because they both deal with the issue of **power**. _This in turn made historians start being more conscious of the effects of their work_- reporting political history without acknowledging the social consequences of the events, for example, was neglectful in the mission to educate people about the past and guide them from making the same mistakes **(p. 138)**.
-	**History of regular life** began to be addressed, and was called **microhistory**. This type of study advocates that **individuals** had their own agency _outside of the social structures of their time period_. It also appeals to more general audiences as well as scholars, creating a _human experience_ aspect to learning history that spread the popularity of studying history even further **(p. 140-1)**.
-	The growth of **women's history** was essential for history, yes, but more importantly it was a growth for humanity as a whole. **Women's history challenged former ideas that the woman's role in society could only be one of a few domestic choices**- a wife, a mother, a maid, a nurse, and so on. Acknowledging that **women played as important roles in history as men did**, and **had as much agency in their lives as men traditionally had** also opened the field up to the study of _how different genders experienced different events_- like in the Renaissance, men experienced more freedoms while women were restricted to even fewer societal roles. **This ability to look at history and how it effects the marginalized leads to more honest accounts of society**, both _historically_, and as a _lens through which to examine current society_ **(p.142-3)**.
-	The **shift away from Eurocentricism** is important, _not_ because it shifted into a new way of looking at history so much as it **acknowledged the flaws of the former way of thinking**. Even "**Orientalist**" history contributed to the Eurocentric tradition, giving the impression that **other nations developed merely in reaction to European developments**. There's no solution proposed, _but the bias is now acknowledged and can be worked with in the development of new histories_ **(p. 146-9)**.
-	**Collective memory** initially was a type of history that **grew from the lack of faith historians had in "recreating" the past as it truly was**. Instead, **culturally important sites** filled in the "gaps," along with **the feelings they inspired in the cultures and communities around them**. Mainly, it's important because the lasting effects of collective memory can be problematic- individual's personal accounts are often _not_ as reliable as historians' research, and the perpetuation of that unreliable evidence in collective memory can lead to a serious _divergence_ in historical accounts, which then lead to later societal problems- like the ones we face today in the United States through the questioning over keeping or tearing down Confederate statues **(p. 149-53)**.
