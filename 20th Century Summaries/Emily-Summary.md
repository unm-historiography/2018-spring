### Glorious Confusion
#### 20th Century Overview Summary 
##### Popkin, pages 127-165
1. The post-war era, and more specifically the 1960’s, was a turbulent time throughout the world, which reflects within historiography. (Popkin, pg. 128). With the release of many African colonies, the beginning of the Cold War, and the raging political change in China, the world was at a *turning point*. The historiography of them time, and the legacy that would last till today, illustrates this change in the way of thinking. 
2. College campuses were one of the main battle grounds for the changing view of history (Popkin, pg. 129). As radical ideas began to filter throughout the US, college students and professors alike grasped onto them and tried to change the academic world. Students wanted history classes relevant to the world around them, like women’s history classes, or “people’s history”. One-hundred years prior, the study of history was reserved for rich men who controlled the narrative. Now, the *common* college student could study any type of history that they wanted. 
3. One major shift within the historiographical world was that of the “people’s history”. Instead of looking at the kings, clergy, and elites, of society, historians were now studying the common man (Popkin, pg. 130). This type of history also studied traditional marginalized groups within society. Women, people of color, and anyone else who had not traditionally held powerful positions, were now all the subjects of study. While this created an important **paradigm shift**, there were critics of the field. Some felt that individual agendas could become more prominent and be more easily accepted if history was revised at an excess rate. 
4. The notion of a **paradigm shift** was also realized during this time period. A concept that has become integral to many social sciences today, the paradigm shift created within this turbulent time period where historiography was getting a face lift. Historical truth was not a constant, but rather a function of the beliefs of the society (Popkin, pg. 135). Hunt and Kuhn, the two historians who would be credited with this discovery, created a new solution to a question that had been asked throughout history. This radical way of thought found its birth in the dawn of a new America. 
5. The rise of women’s history would finally bloom during this time period, thanks to second wave feminism. A desire to begin to include women in the story came about for two reasons. First, women were beginning to find a greater independence outside of the domestic lifestyle. Studying women’s history not only placed women within history, but also gave them stronger footing in the present. Second, this was an entirely new field of study, ripe with job opportunities and positions within academia for women (Popkin, pg. 143). With the new historiographical techniques that arose during this time period, it was now easier to include women in the dialog. While many historians would accept this new group of marginalized people, Foucault would completely ignore women. Much of Foucault's work was with marginalized groups, but there was a distinct lack of women in his narative (Green and Troup, pg. 302).
6. A distaste for Eurocentrism would find its way into the spot light in the later 1960’s. With the traditional power structures being reinforced by western societies, most history had been told from only one perspective. With the decolonization of Africa, and a new view of imperialism, many historians wanted to make the general public “conscious of non-Western historical perspectives” (Popkin, pg. 146). Fixing the imbalance of history focusing on the west, and history concerning the rest of the world, was one of the ways that historians went about this. Many Americans were driven away from the traditional view of imperialism that had been fed to them. The drive away from traditional views on imperialism was one of the things that would spur on this momentous change. 
7. The idea of a *collective memory* arose during this time period. All the members of society had a shared memory, or a history, of their society. This collective memory was especially powerful surrounding traumatic events, like war. The collective memory of the war, no matter if it was historically factual, has just as much power as the actual realities surrounding the war (Popkin, pg. 149). This memory leads to the creation of a strong cultural identity, which can either be helpful or incredibly detrimental to a society. 
8. The idea of "micro-politics", introduced by Foucault, stated that politics were intertwined with the lives of the common man, not just with the larger power structures (Popkin, pg. 138). Foucault’s larger idea behind this was his belief about power. Power was not held just by a single person or group, it filtered through all of society (like government), and similarly, resistance also happens in localized spurts (Green and Troup, pg. 302). Along with Foucault’s theories on power came a more distinct recognition of the power that historians could wield. History could be used as a political tool to inforce a dominant belief, and historians were beginning to realize that there could be consequences from their writings. 
9. Quantitative data, because of newly emerging technology, became more prominent. Historians believed that they could look at data accumulated about large groups of people and draw conclusions about historical trends. Quantitative history also gave historians the ability to look at the lower classes in more depth than they could before. The aspiration for quantitative history came from the desire to merge history with the hard social sciences (Popkin, pg. 131). The main criticism of this was that it no longer was a study of individuals throughout history. It reduced the importance of the individual, and understated the importance of human agency.
