### History in the Late 20th Century
- The 1960s is responsible for new methodological approaches to history and brought employment to many historians (p.127). The theories used in this time period attract literary theorists (Anna Greene,p.6749).
- There is a **shift away from quantitative history and a turning toward demography, oral histories, language, and rhetoric** (p.131-34). This shift is significant because it allows many historians to study subjects that are otherwise be difficult to study. For example, many African histories consist of oral histories. **By using oral history as evidence, historians are able to study African histories.**
- **Michel Foucault** (p.137-38) discusses the role of politics in history, and states that politics, or power, play into every aspect of human life and, therefore, should be studied at every level. Foucault **discusses how historians themselves are powerful in what sources they choose**.This is significant to us as historians because we do in fact have power in what we choose to put out into the world, as we have already discussed in class. Foucault believes that **power works diffusely and locally**. He argues that there is **no real truths, only dominant truths** told by those who hold power (Greene,p.6862). **Historians hold power in their writing**. Foucault's work is very unsettling to those who are influenced by Marx (Greene,p.6877). Marxist thought believes in a single power (the government) that holds control and produces the class conflict. Under poststructuralism, Foucault believes in power being spread thin and held locally.
- From the 1960's to 70's, **women have become more involved in the historical writing process** (p. 143). This is significant for women in the U.S. because it increases job opportunities for women in the historical field. However, **Foucault fails to mention women** in his theoretical writing (Greene,p.6862). **Marx also fails to mention women** and their role in the class struggle (Greene,p.1280).
- During this time, **eurocentrism is questioned as well** (p. 146). Historians begin discussing how people all over the world interpret history. Many historians have to refer to European schools of thought, yet European historians do not have to refer to schools of thought outside of their own (p.147-48). This is significant to us now because we still face Eurocentric views, yet we must remember to consider other views as well. **Terminology has also become an issue for historians when using descriptive terms**. Historian Brian Lewis brought attention to terminology used for homosexuals in *British Queer History*- (Greene,p.6818).
- The idea of a collective memory sparks historians interest in memory itself (p.149-150). Many histories, such as oral histories, rely solely on memory. How reliable are these histories? Although **oral histories may not be 100 percent true, they are helpful to historians studying marginal societies**, however, the historian must remember to be careful when using 'the memory' as a source because **the mind can distort certain events**. Furthermore, how is one to tell the truth behind an interpretation? **The focus on linguistics led to a 'linguistic turn' during the postructuralist era** (Greene,p.6760).
- The 'History Wars' are based on how people, influenced by historians, view the past. Controversies arise in the 80's related to new methodology in history and how it presents the past to its audience (p. 156). This **academic war is significant in showing us how much we still worry about the past and how it is presented** (p. 162). The methodology behind poststructuralism caused debates in the 80's and 90's. Although **theories related to poststructuralism are useful to historians in that they provide the historian with tools to deveolop new histories relevant to postmodernism**, poststructuralism has yet to be mapped out in the field of hisory (Greene,p.6918).
**Poststructuralism eliminates claims to historical objectivity** (Greene,p.6833). **Derrida** mentions that texts are full of unstable meanings (Greene,p.6804), this is **extrememly problematic for the historian!** Texts are an important factor in the historical process because they provide evidence to the claims being made. **It is this divide that will not allows the discipline of history and poststructuralism to be mixed fully.**
