### History in the Late 20th Century
- The 1960s is responsible for new methodological approaches to history and brought employment to many historians (p. 127).
- There is a shift away from quantitative history and a turning toward demography, oral histories, language, and rhetoric (p. 131-34). This shift is significant because it allows many historians to study subjects that are otherwise be difficult to study. For example, many African histories consist of oral histories. By using oral history as evidence, historians are able to study African histories.
- Michel Foucault (p.137-38) discusses the role of politics in history, and states that politics, or power, play into every aspect of human life and, therefore, should be studied at every level. Foucault discusses how historians themselves are powerful in what sources they choose.This is significant to us as historians because we do in fact have power in what we choose to put out into the world, as we have already discussed in class.
- From the 1960's to 70's, women have become more involved in the historical writing process (p. 143). This is significant for women in the U.S. because it increases job opportunities for women in the historical field.
- During this time, eurocentrism is questioned as well (p. 146). Historians begin discussing how people all over the world interpret history. Many historians have to refer to European schools of thought, yet European historians do not have to refer to schools of thought outside of their own (p.147-48). This is significant to us now because we still face Eurocentric views, yet we must remember to consider other views as well.
- The idea of a collective memory sparks historians interest in memory itself (p.149-150). Many histories, such as oral histories, rely solely on memory. How reliable are these histories? Although oral histories may not be 100 percent true, they are helpful to historians studying marginal societies, however, the historian must remember to be careful when using 'the memory' as a source because the mind can distort certain events.
- The 'History Wars' are based on how people, influenced by historians, view the past. Controversies arise in the 80's related to new methodology in history and how it presents the past to its audience (p. 156). This academic war is significant in showing us how much we still worry about the past and how it is presented (p. 162).
