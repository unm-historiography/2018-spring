# ***Historigraphy from the 1960s to 2000***

•	The latter half of the 20th century started with heightened race, revolutionary and class tensions. The political turmoil of the 1960s led to re-examinations of past historical works to undercover a **“new history” that told the stories of historical “poor” and “oppressed” individuals, social groups and ethnicities.** This is historically significant because outside societal pressures led mainstream historians to construct more objective narratives and works. This was an evolution and improvement of Ranke’s concept of objective history (p. 128). 

•	New technologies gave historians more tools at their disposal to study the past. Due to historians having greater access to big data, quantitative history developed by understanding history using trends and statistics. However, this new historical field was shaken when Roger Fogel used his results to downplay the brutality and cruelty of slavery. This change is historically significant because some historians were now looking at data to describe history in the aggregate instead relying on an individual historian’s preferred primary sources (p. 133). 

•	Popkin depicted a new **“paradigm shift” in “history and academia” that broke away from the Enlightenment’s historical viewpoint that knowledge grew over time.** “The historian of science,” Thomas Kunt, outlined this “paradigm shift” by stating that history does not get “truer” or more accurate over time but is reconstructed due to the historical models and themes of the historian's time period. Kunt did not believe that historians would be able to agree on a common “historical truth"(P.134-135). Instead, he believed that disagreements would manifest themselves across cultures and individual vantage points. Kunt recognized that the profession was not going to come together for a common consensus like the early Catholic historians did (p. 134-135). 

•	Paul Ricquor coined the term “chain of generations” that explained how historians interpreted the past based upon their present time period. His work *“Time and Narrative”* (1984) expanded upon the work of Kunt without “dissolving the distinction between history and fiction” that the controversial historian Hayden White had attempted to do. Ricquor’s work is historically significant because it shows the development of a consciousness about the developments of the histriography profession. (p. 137). 

•	**20th century historians were impacted by the “postmodern” era that they lived in** (p. 137). “Cultural and linguistic” historical developments arose as historians became more “self-aware” and open to “pluralistic” approaches (p. 138). Foucault argued that historians should become more “self-aware” of the influence and magnitude of their work while Koselleck argued for multiple “histories” to take root instead on a uniform “history” (p. 139). In the 1960s and 1970s, the third wave of the Annales School focused on cultural and social institutions of society.

•	Microhistory, ecological, cultural and women’s histories were developed as new fields of historical study (p. 140-142). Microhistory focused on individual stories and people to bring attention to the life of one “ordinary” person instead of seeing them as “prisoners of a larger social structure” (p. 140). While ecological and cultural history impacted the historiography field, the introduction of “herstory” to “history” “profoundly changed the historical profession and the content of scholarship” (p. 143-146). **The emergence of microhistory and women’s history was significant because it made the study of history more inclusive and brought new individuals into history that had previously been left out.** 

•	**For the first time in the western world, the “Eurocentric view” of the historical world was challenged** (p. 146). Some historians such as Edward Said, led the movement to construct historical stories with more non-European perspectives. Jan Vansina fought to recognize the importance of African oral stories in their study of history (p. 147). This development allowed for a more global historical perspective.  

•	The increased popularity of history in the late 20th century did not come without controversies. Culture wars ensued about the origins and accuracy of national history. **“History Wars” flourished as scholars and politicians debated popular and academic history** (p. 153). President Reagan only spoke about the bright spots of American history while his administration fought to dismantle “political correct” history (p. 157). The issue of political correctness was a hotly contested issue between academia and politicians because both sides claimed the other was misperceiving history in a subjective not objective manner. The “History Wars” over the accuracy of the past could be best illustrated by George Orwell’s 1948 novel *“1984”* that “he who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” (p. 113). 

•	The battle for the past was not just limited to debates between politicians and academia. **The accuracy and importance of historical truth was a hotly contested issue.** In 1973, Hayden White’s *Metahistory: The Historical Imagination of 19th Century Europe* upset the majority of academia’s historians by calling historical narratives “fictions” (p. 136). While popular culture may not have characterized all historical narratives as "fictions," popular culture challenged the importance of historical truth. Disney developed a representation of President Abraham Lincoln that David Lowenthal, a scholarly historian, described as **“better a misinformed enjoyment of history than none, a lighthearted dalliance with the past than a wholesale rejection of it”** (p. 155). Despite Lowenthal’s support for Disney’s historical works, popular history remained a controversial topic among late 20th century scholarly historians. 

1. I made grammatical improvements to the summary entry by fixing typos and improving the readability of the sentences. After looking at other GitHub entries, I improved the title of my entry by properly formatting it as a header. 

2. I also added a bullet point expanding on the context of "history wars" and the battle for historical truth. Even though I mentioned Hayden White's work in the bullet point about the "paradigm shift" in history, my summary needed to address his work's impact in greater detail because it was a crucial part of our class discussion.
