## From Herodotus to H-Net (p. 25-35)

- Historiography is the history of writing history, but historiography only started being studied in the 19th century, millennia after the actually recording of history began. Before then, historical writing was considered a branch of literature. During the 19th century, history fist became regaded as a subject worthy of study by itself. (p. 25)
- During the 20th century, history was written as a "story of progress," meaning that the recording of history moved from one that relied on myth and religion to one that adopted a more scientific approach. This tradition focused mainly on the Western world (Europe and North America), and largely ignored the way history had been recorded in the rest of the world. (p. 25)
- No matter what definition of "history" historians use, historiographical works regard Herodotus and Thuycydides as great historians. Both authors created works that strove to provide an understanding of the world, and present it realistically. _They were not the first historians to record historical events,_ but their version of history was unique because they tried to define history as a [specific method of telling a story about the past by telling the truth]. Their work was also important because their history was about [people], and not gods, and they wrote about events they could verify.(p. 26-7) 
- Herodotus and Thucydides inspired the later Western historiographical tradition. Their definition of history and the fact that they wrote down their histories were both very important foundations for this particular historiographical tradition, which implemented both ideas. Niether historian is perfect, however. Herodotus recorded false information into much of his work, and Thucydides exibited bias that human existence was "tragic," but their two styles of writing history still influence historians today. (p. 29-30)
- Aristotle considered that history had a closer relationship with "empirical truth" than poetry. This classification of history became one of the characterizations that distinguishes the study of history from other methods of thought. (p.30-31)
- Later Greek and Roman Scholars, like Polybius, Livy, and Tacitus, had problems recording history because their sources were different chronologies, which did not agree on systems of counting time. Roman scholars especially struggled with this because of the massive size of the Roman Empire. Because of the size and range of different cultures encourporated into the empire, reconciling the different records into one comprehensive history was more difficult than it had been for Herodotus and Thucydides. (p. 31)
- Before Polybius, the recording of history was focused on [national history],or the history of one smaller area over time. Begining with Polybius, Poman historians focused on the [cause] of Rome's success, and afterthe fall of the Republic, historians again shifted to focusing on [why] Rome declined. (p.32) Each of these shifts in how history was recorded reflects how the recording of history changes over time, which is important to consider when studying the history. It could reveal reasons for why some things are recorded or left out, or if the reason for biases.
