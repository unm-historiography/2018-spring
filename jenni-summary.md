## From Herodotus to H-Net (p. 25-35)

- Historiography is the history of writing history, but historiography only started being studied in the 19th century, millennia after the actually recording of history began. Before then, historical writing was considered a branch of literature. During the 19th century, history fist became regaded as a subject worthy of study by itself. (p. 25)
- During the 20th century, history was written as a "story of progress," meaning that the recording of history moved from one that relied on myth and religion to one that adopted a more scientific approach. This tradition focused mainly on the Western world (Europe and North America), and largely ignored the way history had been recorded in the rest of the world. (p. 25)
- No matter what definition of "history" historians use, historiographical works regard Herodotus and Thuycydides as great historians. Both authors created works that strove to provide an understanding of the world, and present it realistically. _They were not the first historians to record historical events,_ but their version of history was unique because they tried to define history as a [specific method of telling a story about the past by telling the truth]. Their work was also important because their history was about [people], and not gods, and they wrote about events they could verify.(p. 26-7) 
- Herodotus and Thucydides inspired the later Western historiographical tradition. Their definition of history and the fact that they wrote down their histories were both very important foundations for this particular historiographical tradition, which implemented both ideas. Niether historian is perfect, however. Herodotus recorded false information into much of his work, and Thucydides exibited bias that human existence was "tragic," but their two styles of writing history still influence historians today. (p. 29-30)
- Aristotle considered that history had a closer relationship with "empirical truth" than poetry. This classification of history became one of the characterizations that distinguishes the study of history from other methods of thought. (p.30-31)
- Later Greek and Roman Scholars, like Polybius, Livy, and Tacitus, had problems recording history because their sources were different chronologies, which did not agree on systems of counting time. Roman scholars especially struggled with this because of the massive size of the Roman Empire. Because of the size and range of different cultures encourporated into the empire, reconciling the different records into one comprehensive history was more difficult than it had been for Herodotus and Thucydides. (p. 31)
- Before Polybius, the recording of history was focused on [national history],or the history of one smaller area over time. Begining with Polybius, Poman historians focused on the [cause] of Rome's success, and afterthe fall of the Republic, historians again shifted to focusing on [why] Rome declined. (p.32) Each of these shifts in how history was recorded reflects how the recording of history changes over time, which is important to consider when studying the history. It could reveal reasons for why some things are recorded or left out, or if the reason for biases.
- During the Roman Empire, the focus of historical writing shifted again to the idea that [history needed to record the failings of the time period], such as the failings of tyranical emperors and the excessive decadence of the Roman people. Biography, as a genre, also grew thanks to Plutarch, but it's uncertain whether biography is a form of history or whether it is inherantly too biased towards the individual agency of subjects over the context of their lives. Memoirist accounts are a major form of writing about the past, although often are biased favorably towards the author that wrote them. However, they have the ability to record events as they were seen first-hand, and give insight into the emotions and thought processes of the recorder as the event occured. (p. 33)

## Faces of History (p.48-69)
#What's different than FHTH

- The antiquarians pursued the writing of history in order to study the language and culture of past peoples, unlike historiographers that, as the author claims, pursue history to record it as a "pleasant narrative." The Roman jurists pursued history the same way that most historians do, by going to "the beginning" to find the origins of laws, culture, and history. (p. 49) 
- Livy's first pentad of history dealt with archaeology- the study of the obscure part of history, which was considered obscure because there was little written record of it and it happened in the more distant past. His sitory is ususally read a s _"a chain of portraits and stories,"_ but formalist scholars have interpreted what seems to by a _cyclical nature of events_. This cycle consists of a focus on great historical figures and crisis events, and follows a pattern similar to the idea that Livy may have had that Rome was "an empire without end." (p. 59-60) This seems to be indicative of a bias.
- Tacitus's historical writings focused on comparing peoples and observing their failings- especially in the case of the Germanic tribes neighboring the Roman Empire. His history analyzes their differences from Romans and draws negative conclusions based on this. For example, the habit of Germanic drinking and the fact that they did not have cities were some of the focuses of Tacitus's assessments of their history. (p. 61)
- Tacitus observed a pattern of human history that frames the begining of humanity as a group that lived in innocence, which then moved into a period of violence due to human greed, and then moved into a period of peace and order with the formation of law, and then another cycle of violence. 
- The historian's purpose, as the author thinks of it, in writing historical record is to [commemorate, instruct, and record the truth]. (p. 63)
- Hiastory and rhetoric, while intimately tied, are not the same. Historians do rely on rhetoric to record history in a way that is readable and has a meaningful analysis. Styles of writing history differ from each other, but all attempt to record the truth. Roman historians following different styles of writing were not "objective," but instead tried to celebrate the virtues of Rome, and each of the styles can aid in identifying the biases. (p. 65)
The laws of writing history has a set of rules according to the Roman tradition of writing history are 1. the author must always strive to tell the truth and 2. the author must be unafraid to tell the truth. In short, there should be no bias in history writing. (p. 66)
