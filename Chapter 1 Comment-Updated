# **What is Historiography?**
## Chapter 1
The implications of historiography are simply defined in this phrase: *the relationship between the methods of getting reputable information about history and the different ways of doing so*. How does this apply to the subject? It relies on the desire of questioning the information that was obtained "reputably" and the historical explanations of events. By questioning the information, revealing history to be a story about stories, so therefore **everything** is under scruntiny. Every form of reliable information, every text that is a secondary source, every primary source, were all written from a biased point of view and as historians, we must learn how to distinguish and even critique history. Popkin goes onto say that the historical past is not "out there" and that it instead must be reconstructed with evidence (p. 6). This is an example of the subject itself. 

History is preeminently theoretical, fundamentally up to interpretation of the reader. This makes history controversial and debatable, but if it *weren't*, how could we understand the thought processes of historians of the past? It would be impossible to come to any conclusion. The aim is to **not** enforce one's own opinion onto the historical figure, but that is easier said than done. There are certain procedures to follow to avoid this, and to understand the depth of historiography, one must understand their individual role as a historian in this process. 

The importance of history is not limited to the ability to comprehend and analyze, but as a reminder that records are being made. This makes everyone informed of their accountability; the "important" people will be recorded, and their actions will be written down. This goes without saying, but even the bias will be recorded, and it is up to future historians to discern the meaning behind the written record. While history is a means of record-keeping, it also serves as a portal to the past. It keeps the past close to heart and not out of mind, for those that care to listen and understand.

While history has served as a form of pushing political agendas as well, it can be the only voice of the human experience as a form of representation. Political, cultural, intellectual and economic history provides the researcher a premise to act upon; a field of specialty and focus. These subgroups show the variety of historical literature and provide the history student an opportunity to reflect upon their interests.
