 - Though a clear understanding of Foucault's writing is beside me, it can be inferred correctly or incorrectly, that Foucalt's main points concern the **transition or "rebirth" of knowledge and power of the medical profession** into the modern century. Foucault states, "the space of _configuration_ of the disease and the space of _localization_ of the illness in the body have been superimposed ,in medical experience, for only a relatively short period of time-the period that coincides with the nineteenth-century medicine and the privileges according to pathological anatomy." (p. 3) Thus, previous medical knowledge and concern was **based on a heirarchical system of classification** which placed diseases according to this classification stating, "disease is given an organization, heirarchized into families, genera, and species." (p.4) Furthermore, "the distiction between knowledge and the philosophical **is not** the distinction between **cause and effect**" and "the historical embraces whatever, _de facto or de jure_," sooner or later, directly or indirectly." (p. 5) Therefore, medical attention was based on **resembalance and ordering of diseases** _rather_ than explicit or **empirical evaluation**. In addition, one must turn away from **"mathematical"** forms of knowledge which **homogenize diseases** and **embrace each equilibrium** of the of the disease. 
 
- What it most interesting about Foucault is that the relation of diseases, epidemics, the body, and doctors, manifest into **national and economic issues**. Stating, "the definition of the political status for medicine and the constitution, at state level, of a medical consciousness whose constant task would be to provide information, supervison, and constraint , all of which **'relate as much to the police as to the field of medicine proper**." (p.26) Therefore, these issues "proliferate into the dimensions of a history, a geography, and a state." (p. 29) Thus, the **medical space** can coincide with **social spaces** which allows for traversion. Furthermore, knowledge is not just for the doctor but now the patient which is, "diffused in space and time, open and mobile, linked to **each individual existence**, as well as to the **collective life of the nation**." (p.31)
