In Foucalt's *Archaeology of Knowledge*, he argues that past events and interpretations of them are fallible at best. **He reasons that we are often inept at explaining the discourse in our own eras, and this problem is only magnified when we try to extend our understanding to eras we are far removed from and lack contextual clarity of** (AoK pp.22-23). I found this to be an interesting observation and argument which I agree has some merit, but also lacks a clear direction to go in with this assertion. I do believe it to be important for historians to be aware of intrinsic bias and have a self-awareness of the contextual lens in which they study past events and eras, but for these studies to be useful historians must also identify the relevance of these facts in how they can help us to learn or grow in the present and future. Foucalt's critique seems to border on more of a nihilistic attitude rather than optimism to my reading. 

From what I can extrapolate form Foucault's *Birth of the Clinic*, **he uses the organization, labeling, and classification of diseases by doctors to illustrate how we like to attempt to simplify things that are beyond are grasp of understanding.** This point is interesting as it does correlate with critiques of historical models we have looked at previously that use broad explanatory models to classify and organize the past.
