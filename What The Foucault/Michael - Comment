### So, What The Foucault? - A Commentary and Such

It is rather unfortunate that for today’s reading, we are assigned the role of commentators, rather than question-writers, for as I go through Foucault and the two selected passages, I am left with a plethora of questions, most of them to the effect of _“What the Foucault?”_ Seriously, this man – and these readings – embody everything I hate about pretentious philosophic scholarship entering the discipline of historiography. Furthermore, the assignment reminds me how passionately I disliked courses taken on philosophy. _What the Foucault?_

**Continuity and relativity** seem the be the points of highest importance throughout the selections. Questions of relativity are posed regarding one author to another, as well as an author’s specific work to another piece of theirs. Every book “is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences: it is a node within a network…its unity is variable and relative” (Discourse, p. 23). The observations of Foucault are both notable and relevant to the theme of the course. One must constantly evaluate a historian’s motives and the perspective from which they write. Naturally, historians will be influenced by others before them and the works they produced. By this, it is impossible to evaluate historiographical works without considering those that (directly or otherwise) influenced them. To the persisting question, _“What the Foucault?”_, the first answer arises: **all history and relevant works are relative and influenced by one another**. Continuity, the other point of importance, can be discussed through Foucault’s example of tradition (Discourse, p. 21).
