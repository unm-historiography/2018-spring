## This is not Sparta but it is Foucault 
# Not sure what that means either 

Okay so. 
In *The Archaeology of Knowledge* the main points I gathered from this series of questions with unclear answers was this: 
History has abandoned its uniqueness in favor of stable structures within. **what** exactly that means, I am not certain. I interpret it 
it like this: History should not enter into the structures of their hierarchy. It should remain fundamentally different than other
"humanities" like Greek and Roman philosophy.
