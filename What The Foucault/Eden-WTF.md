## This is not Sparta but it is Foucault 
### Not sure what that means either 

In *The Archaeology of Knowledge* the main point I gathered from this *series of questions with unclear answers* was this: History has abandoned its uniqueness in favor of stable structures within. **What** exactly that means, I am not certain. However, this is my "translation" of what I considered to be the important points within *The Archaeology of Knowledge*: 
History should not enter into the structures of other disciplines, like other humanities because history must remain unique. The *Archeology of Knowledge* says that there are *displacements* and *transformations*.  There are certain things *only* history can do. For example, history can  "transform documents into monuments". Nonetheless, there are *four consequences* of this: 
* The increase in discontinuities within "the history of ideas." 
* The "notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines" (p. 8) and utilize raw materials of history  
*  The possibility of a total history disappears. 
* The new history is confronted by "a number of methodological problems" (p. 10). 

I interpret these points as statement of how decentralized history uses the "raw materials of history" which therefore makes a total history impossible. One cannot have a cohesive, *total* history if the ideas within are part of this grand narrative. So *true* history cannot be a total history. 

I have to make a comment on those points I listed above. I think that it's complete bullshit. Certainly, within the historical record there are displacements and transformations of the past. Yes, I acknowledge that. I also acknowledge that staying tied to a certain methodology in need of stability is one way to write history. History has not abandoned its uniqueness but has made *necessary adaptations to stay relevant*. Nonetheless, it is not the worst thing that has happened to the historical narrative. (I'm pretty positive Vico's *Theory of Societal Progression* is **worse** than what the Foucault I just read.) 

In *The Birth of the Clinic*, I found the main points to be even more muddled. The introduction is focused on space and the advent of medicine in the 18th century. 
"In disease, one recognizes life because it is on the law of life that knowledge of the disease is also based" (p. 7). That honestly is the only line in the entire reading that I both understood and am able to truly reflect upon. I think a translation of *The Birth of the Clinic* needs to have that quote in it. Without further ado, here is my translation: 

* Everything has an embodied form and like a disease, everything reveals "its class, its genus, and its species" in the beginning of its nature (p. 8). 
* Since everything has a form, everything takes up space. 
* Following a natural progression, the medical field and "the medicine of individual perception" becomes either a collective or integrated (p. 20).

I begin with a question. If everything has a form and within that form, it is significant, is significance inherently in a "form"? Is disease a life? "In disease, one recognizes life because it is on the law of life that knowledge of the disease is also based" (p. 7). So like *Ying and Yang*, there is no life without death and no decay without disease. 
As someone with a debilitating and chronic autoimmune disease, I find this confusing and upsetting. My spatial orientation has certainly changed since my diagnosis, but I have the institutions of conventional and modern medicine to thank for my treatment. I am *dependent* upon them. 
"The sick man is no doubt incapable of working, but if he is placed in a hospital he becomes a double burden for society" (p.18) and if he is not healed and leaves the hospital, if nothing happens, the disease is left to appear and extinguish-- "and the assistance that is given in the home will make up for the poverty that the disease has caused" (p. 19). It has not only killed the disease but the humanity of the person with the disease. 

So to sum: **Fuck off, Foucault**.
