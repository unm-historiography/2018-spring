## What the Foucault? I Don't Know, I Found A Good Point.

Foucault’s main point seems to be that **analyzing anything within the sciences is not restricted only to the same field as that particular science**. (Archeology, p.30) I like this approach, at least, as it applies to history, because it falls in line with (almost) everything we’ve talked about with the evolution of the writing of history up to this point. Herodotus wanted to only use accounts of events that could be verified, the Annales School strove for accuracy, hard, scientifically tested evidence was used increasingly in the recordings of history, and even historical fiction branches into another field— fiction, which in turn tends to rely on psychology to manipulate the views of readers, to make them feel certain ways about events or historical figures. History is not just an isolated field. As historians, we rely on linguistics to translate accounts from one language to another, we rely on economics to interpret trade records, we even rely on biology and immunology to understand details, like how the Black Plague, a massive, literally society-changing event, was spread. Nothing in the realm of academic study is isolated to one field.
