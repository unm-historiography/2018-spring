WTF?

After my first reading of the two works, I found myself a little lost and confused. The sheer volume of questions posed by Foucault throughout the works was somewhat overwhelming, while clear answers to those posed questions remained unclear. It appears that in both *Archeology of Knowledge* and *The Birth of the Clinic*, **Foucault remains focused on the idea of unity, or this idea that all of history has, been to this point, unified to other historical works through divisions (such as politics and economics), thus removing the individuality of the historical topic (whether it through the sources used for research or from trying to illuminate the bigger picture).**

Having read both works twice, it seems that Foucault is unhappy with the "unity" that has formed within the history profession, especially with how historians appear to recycle the same information and sources into new historical works. *"The frontiers of a book are never clear-cut; beyond the title, the first lines, and the last full stop, beyond its internal configuration and its autonomous form, it is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences; it is a node within a network" (Archeology of Knowledge, p. 23).* It seems that Foucault was calling out historians for their continuous use of the same sources, from the same books, written by the same people. **He is not impressed with this approach and calls for historical writing/research needs to be done in a way that rids it of its unities and allows the bare, fundamental aspects of the history being studied to shine through.** *"instead of providing a basis for what already exists, instead of going over with bold strokes lines that have already been sketchedâ€¦one is forced to advance beyond familiar territory, far from the certainties to which one is accustomed, towards an as yet uncharted land and unforeseeable conclusion" (Archeology of Knowledge, p. 38).* 

While Foucault seemed pretty opposed to the idea of unities when studying history as they can blind the individual from understanding the fundamental parts of a particular topic because of the stressed importance on understanding the grand narrative. It seems that Foucault wanted to flip what was going on in the historiographical world but trying to sway attention away from the same old approach to going out to exploring new things by trying to understand them as being a single/individual topic, instead of trying to understand them in the bigger context. It seemed that Foucault wanted to stress the idea of no unity/unities through his work, particularly in *The Birth of the Clinic*, where he creates a great analogy using the medicinal profession. I found his writing about doctor/patient relationships and the technology that was aiding doctors in their search to understand the *"family"* or fundamental aspects of disease *(The Birth of the Clinic, p. 17-18)* was very interesting because Foucault, again, stressed the idea of no unity. He believed that the classification aspect to medicine is where the field needs to focus on. **It was more important to understand the "essence" of the topic than the general overview; specific and individual, not unitied to a bigger picture.**
