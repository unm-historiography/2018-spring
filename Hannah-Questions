## Ancient History Discussion Questions

- Do you agree that the *beginning* of the story or event is the **most important** place to start or can one begin at a different point and still present a full picture of events. (p.49)

- Livy was not a traveler nor did he have political or military experience as Herodotus and Thucydides respectively did. Is it important for historians to have **experience** about what they are writing or is research enough to understand past actions? (p.57)


- Dose Popkin's view of Roman historians hold up after reading Kelley's *Roman Foundations*?


-  Do you agree that Thucydides is a more traditional historian while Herodotus is as Popkin describes it has "more innovative" (p.30)? How dose Herodotus's inclusion of *women* in his history play into the idea of what a **traditional historian** should write about?


- Are biographies a form of history or are are they too focused on the individual (p.33)? Do they not give enough context to the events discussed outside of the individual?
