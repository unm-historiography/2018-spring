### Annales Questions
Jerome T. Mondragon

1. Fernand Braudel has been heavily criticized for _The Mediterranian_ because of it's lack of people, religion, and culture within the work. (Green and Troup, p. 90) Because of its heavy emphasis on geography, could his work be considered as history?

2. Braudel describes the layers of historical time which includes geographical time, economic cycles, and politcal history. (Green and Troup, p. 89) How can these layers be used to create new historical topics or literature?

3. _Mentalites_ attempts to study the workings of inner society. (Green and Troup, p. 92) In _The Prince_, Machiavelli asserts that he's speaking for the ordinary person. (Prince p. 4) Is his work a precursor to the Annales? Could Machiavelli be considered a member of the Annales?

4. In _The Mediterranean_, Fernand Braudel mentions that mountains are responsible for "cruel and romantic outlaws." (Green and Troup, p. 92) Could this claim be applied to other terrains other than mountains? Are there any other contributing factors?

5. In Braudel's _The Mediterranean_, his placements of events seem to be completely sporatic.  (Green and Troup, p. 98-109) Does contemporary historical work, or historical work in general, need to be written in chronological model? Does his work have a claim? Does it needs one?

8: good introductions to questions, and have a nice balance of particular and general concerns. room for improvement: provide a beginning of an answer to your questions in terms of how you would answer it.
