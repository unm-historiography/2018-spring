### Annales Questions
Jerome T. Mondragon

1. Fernand Braudel describes the layers of historical time which includes geographical time, economic cycles, and politcal history. (Green and Troup, p. 89) How can these layers to create new historical topics or literature?

2. _Mentalites_ attempts to study of the workings of inner society. (Green and Troup, p. 92) In _The Prince_, Machiavelli asserts that he's speaking for the ordinary person. (Prince p. 4) Is his work a precursor to the Annales? Could Machiavelli be considered a member of the Annales?

3. In _The Mediterranean_, Fernand Braudel mentions that mountains are responsible for "cruel and romantic outlaws." (Green and Troup, p. 92) Could this claim be applied to other terrains other than mountains? Are there any other contributing factors?
4. Braudel has been heavily criticized for _The Mediterranian_ because of it's lack of people, religion, and culture within the work. Because of its heavy emphasis on geography, could his work be considered as history?
