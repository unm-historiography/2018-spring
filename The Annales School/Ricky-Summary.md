## The Annales School
### Summary

- *The Annales* school of thought branched away from the stringent rules of the Scientism theories of Ranke. In this effort, they intended to break from political and diplomatic topics. (Erikson p. 87). This is seen in the *Annales* founders works, Lucien Febvre’s thesis on Phillippe II included geographical data and how that shaped social and cultural aspects of his life (p. 88). 

- Febvre and Bloch led the charge for the *Annales* ideal of a “total history”, that every party of society was an important contribution to history. (p. 88). This idea stems trying to break this dependence on political sources. In *The Mediterranean*, Braudel highlights a king’s power not in his actions, but in control of the geography, where Phillip II was a “ruler indeed of the roads, passes, towns, and plains, but… [not] the Balkan highlands” (p. 100). 

- The *Annales* style of historical research became popular due to a student of Febrve named Braudel. He created *The Mediterranean*, which expressed new theories of how time should be viewed in the style of an ocean (p. 88-89). While three distinct **layers** of time are present, they intersect, as it is the “relationship between the structures which illuminates society and its history” (p. 89). Braudal claimed that historians were purely utilizing the smallest layer, the crest of foam on waves that represent political information. This ties into the theory of total history, as all layers are important to the story. 

- While the *Annales* were largely applauded, some believed a “total history” to be impossible (p. 90). One effort to combat this was pursuing **histroire promleme**, applying problem-solving to historical research. This naturally led to identifying causal factors with quantification (p. 91). This is seen in *The Mediterranean*, where **Braudel lists specific elevations that various trees and produce grow** (p. 102). In fact, there are more trees than people in this work. (p. 104). 

- The inability for the *Annales* to create a meta-narrative for historical change has been a thorn in their methods (p. 93). This factors in to the inability to apply the *Annales* methods to the present. While the use of geography works aptly to mountain people in the age of Phillip II, **it could not apply to the modern world**, where these geographical features make a much *smaller impact* on people’s lives. 

- A natural evolution of the Annales led to the focus on **mentalites**, the study of common lives and how they shape their society (p. 92). This aimed to *fix* the ever-present argument of objectivity in history. While not exactly a new thought, **the application of this opened up an incredible amount of source material to a historian**. Mentalites links back to “total history”, yet further aligned the ideals of the Annales with modern day historiographical methods.
