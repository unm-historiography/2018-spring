- The Annales school was instrumental in shaping twentieth century historical writing and studies. Primarily it achieved this through distancing it's focus and methods from those of political history as a dominating perspective, and insisted that the roles of economics and cultural sources be given more creedence. (p.87)
- Fernand Braudel introdoces the concept of historical time as layers moving at different speeds. The slowest being man's relationship with the environment, what Braudel labels as gegraphical time. The middle layers include societal structures such as economic cycles, trade, and population fluctuations. Braudel argued that traditional historians up to this point had only been focusing on the thinnest layer of these, which has to do with the more traditional political and diplomatic events and evidence. (p.89)
- Braudel argues that geography should be viewed as a primary agent in how history has unfolded, stepping away from tradional focus on individuals and events in this role. Critics of this model argued that Braudel's theory was too narrowly focused and lacked the importance of culture, religion, agriculture, and other human factors. (p.90)
- Annales shool historians shift their focus in the 1970's to the study of what they refer to as _mentalites_ This study approach focuses on examining and explaining the daily experience and viewpoints of ordinary individuals in order to shape the inner workings of the societies these people lived in. (p.92)
- The Annales school has received criticisms for it's lack of highlighting the role of gender in much of it's studies. Attempts have been made to correct this oversight, but more remains to be done to correct this. (p.93)
- The overall legacy of the Annales school is the search for underlying structures through various groundbreaking methodolofical approaches in an attempt to tell a more complete and accurate history. (p.94)
