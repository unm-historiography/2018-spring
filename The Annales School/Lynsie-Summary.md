### The Houses of History "The Annales”, p. 87-109
#### Summary

1.  **The Annales School produced some of the most significant innovations in history writing in the twentieth-century.** While the historian's within the "school" work varied among each other, they were "united in terms of theoretical and methodological principles" (p. 87). Professors **Lucien Febvre** and **Marc Bloch** founded these innovations because they felt French history was "sterile" and wanted to incorporate other human science disciplines. (p. 87)

1. The **first "generation"** of historians began with the founding of the Annales School and led by Febvre and Bloch. Febvre and Bloch emphasized and "promulgated an ideal of **historie totale**, arguing that all aspects of society were part of the historical reality" (p. 88).   This concept was in _direct opposition from Rankean theory of political history that had dominated historical writing_ (p. 88).

1. **Fernand Braudel's** thesis, _La Méditeranée_, "rocketed the _Annales_ version of history" in France. In his thesis, he proposed a **new model of historical time** expressed by the ocean of a metaphor, where each speed of time was aligned with different historical topics (p. 88-89). These different cycles are comparable to Nietzsche's three types of history. These three **durées**, as well as the way Braudel conceived time, allowed him to converge his historical writing with Febrve and Bloch's "aim of writing a total history." (p. 80-90).

1. The study of **_mentalités_**, beginning in the 1970s, "foregrounded _ordinary_ people's own experience of their lives and sought to display the inner workings of society" (p. 92). This shift in the "third generation" of the Annales School emphasized the use of different sources such as art, architecture, and inquisitorial records to analyze the values and attitudes common people had toward religion, work, and other aspects of daily life. Two famous examples come from the works of **Georges Duby** and **Emmanuel Le Roy Laudrie** (p. 92). These studies led to **"a new mode of reconstructing the past"** (p. 94).

1. Despite **criticism against Braudel**, the author offers unwavering support of his thesis and describes it as "one of the great works of twentieth-century history" (p. 94). Many of the criticisms against Braudel centered around his lack of "connection" to time with his durées, that his thesis was "curiously devoid of people", and "substitut[ed] description for explanation" (p. 90, 94).

1. The opening excerpt of Braudel's thesis, _La Méditeranée_, argues that the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean "were the refuge of liberty, democracy, and peasant 'republics'" (p. 100). He demonstrates that the **mountains were a great equalizer** and thus these villages maintained true freedom. Without the geographic advantage, they would have a completely different cultural experience (p. 98-101).

1. The **mountain ranges of the Mediterranean were lush with natural resources**, such as various types trees, dairy, meat, and minerals. While these raw materials varied by region, the advantages of the mountains were not meager (p. 102-104). **"Life there is possible, but not easy"**. Braudel describes in detail the various ecological advantages the mountains had but also detailed the hard labor required to utilize them (p. 104).

1. **The social and cultural barrier between mountain dwellers and townspeople echoes the geographic boundary between the two groups** (p 108). Townspeople quickly found themselves superior to the mountain dwellers who come to live in the town and caused a divide between the two. Rarely did these two groups intermarry due to the prejudice against the mountain dwellers, despite their contributions to the lowland towns (p. 108-109).
