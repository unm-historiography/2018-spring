##### Houses, “The Annales”, 87-109

- Green and Troup state that the conceptual foundation of the _Annales_ were first published by Febvre and Bloch who rejected the monopoly of French politics which dominated its history. Instead they wanted to focus on multiple aspects of development and its effects on the **region** by intergrating the social, cultural, and political relationships of individuals that made up its community. Thus, synthesizing a "total history". (p.88) Therefore, do we only reconstruct our "school" of thought when our livelihood is jeopordized whether that be from economic, political, or cultural change? 

- Green and Troup concern, "while the _Annales_ methods have been applied very successfully to pre-industrial societies, they genreally have not been and perhaps cannot be used to interrogate faster-paced modern societies where change is quick and sometimes of paramount historical importance." (p. 93) Therefore, in the 21st century, have we been able to progress _Annales_ histories due to the rapidness of *globalization* and the accessability of social media? Can modern technology accomplish this feat or will political and econimic forums continue to perpetuate the "lack of meta-narrative?" (p.93)

- The second half of _Houses_ focuses on **geography**, the influence or lack thereof between the mountain and lowland communities in the Mediterranean. Roads are the connecting force that ground these two histories/cultures together. As the _Annales_ suggests, "Indeed, Mediterranean life is such a powerful force that when compelled by necessity it can break through the obstacles imposed by hostile terrain." (p. 102) Thus, is our history explicitly bound to our geography? Again, does it take **economic** strife to force these narratives into a coalesced history?

- Green and Troup state," A social and cultural barrier is raised to replace the imperfect geographical barrier which is always being broken in a variety of ways."(p. 108) Overcoming disparities seem to be a common thread in histories, the *Us vs. Them*, Men vs. Woman. Have _Annales_ aided in breaking down these barriers or are we still stuggling to execute _Annal_ philosophies given our current political and social context? As globalization continues to infiltrate the "mountains and lowlands" can "barriers" truly be overcome?
