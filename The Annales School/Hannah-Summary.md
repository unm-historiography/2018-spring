## The *Annales* School Summary

- The Annales School changed the way history was written by
interacting with other disciplines and focusing on economic and cultural history **(p.87)**. By looking beyond the individual and political history the **Annales school studied peoples and cultures that had been overlooked in the past**.

- French historians Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch began the Annales journal in 1929 as a response to the french view of history that focused solely on political and diplomatic topics **(p.87)**. *They wanted to see how the different academic disciplines could help in the study of past events and give a more rounded view of history regarding the lower classes in society*.

- Febvre and Bloch promoted the idea and study of **"total history arguing that all aspects of a society were part of historical reality (p.88)."** The idea of total history had been written about before but Febvre and Bloch argued that total history should be at the **"forefront of the human sciences"(p.88)** By studying total history people would get a fuller picture of history at all leaves and from multiple disciplines.

- Braudel viewed time as a metaphor of the ocean. He had three layers of time. **The first and slowest was "man in his relationship to the environment" which was geographical time, the second** *"duree or conjonctures* **was equivalent to swelling currents" and the third one as historie evenementielle or the ephemera of history" (p.89).**

- A weakness of the Annales school was its discussion of women and gender which was often ignored. This has been addressed a little with the multi-volume *A history of Women* edited by Duby and Perrot but it is still an area of studying that the school is missing and there are other more serious and pioneering work **(p.93).**

- In Fernand Brudel's *The Mediterranean and The Meditierranean World in the Age of Philip II* he writes about how geography and geographical history can and should be viewed by different lenses. Regarding culture, economic changes, movement of people, food and political events (p.98-104).
