## Questions On Macro and Microhistory

- Do historians need to have a clear set of questions that they will focus on in their writing? *Does having questions before historians began to look at sources influence their research* and as Medick's argues **prejudice** the conclusions they make **(Iggers. 105)**? Or is Kocka correct in saying that it is impossible to formulate new and useful ways of thinking and looking at history without a set of clearly defined questions **(Iggers. 105)**?

- Iggers writes that one of the reasons the Italians has such a strong foundation and influence regarding micro-history is a result of a long history of institutional basis in the journal *Quaderni Storici* **(p.108)**. *Does a historical school of thought or a particular method need its own journal for growth*, as Iggers suggests regarding the influence and development of micro-history in Germany **(p.109)**?

- The *microstoria* way of writing history must include the researcher's personal point view, as it requires the historian to show the reader how they reached their conclusion **(Iggers. 110)**. While historians can never fully remove their own viewpoints and ideologies from their writing, *should the reader judge historians of micro-history differently because they must include how their thought processes led to their conclusions?*

- Iggers writes that most microhistorians have a negative view of modernization and because of this they do not believe that grand narratives are possible and look on the past with nostalgia **(p.112)**. *Are the microhistorians current or does their dislike of the modern world cloud their judgement of grand narratives?*

- One aspect that makes micro-history challenging is that many of the sources microhistorians use are harder to fine and personal, such as memoirs and oral history **(Iggers. 114)**. Oral history has made a very large contribution to the personal accounts of Holocaust and helped to show the world how horrible things were. Yet there are a limited amount of time in which to record oral history. Because micro-history often relies on personal accounts and oral history. *Is there a time limit on when it can been written?*

- Anthropology has helped to include the history of forgotten people and groups, however, it is still mainly written by other people **(Green and Troup. 176-178)**. *Does history of forgotten people need to be written by members of from that group?*
