-   French scholar Emile Durkheim believed that *"human behavior is fundamentally shaped by the moral, religious and social society in which the individual lives."(Houses p.173)* He asserts that the collective social group is therefore more important to focus on than the individual. This is a stark contrast to the Italian practitioners of *microstoria*, who believed that maco views of history lose the human element in the process of focusing on too broadly.(Iggers p.107-108) **Do you believe that this competition of ideas serves to help or hurt our understanding of the past? Could these two models help to explain elements of the other?**

-  Anthropology has helped to fill in gaps of history by offering cultural analysis of groups that have been excluded from many written historical recoreds. This is helpful in how it allows an alternative perspective through these cultures artifacts and evidence, such as language, clothes and gestures. (Houses p. 177-179). **Do you think this adds well into the *Annales* historian view of *total history*? What are the similarities between this kind of study and those of *mentalites* of the Annales school?** (Houses p. 92-94)

-  Some concerns have been raised over microhistory studies being done in Germany to better uderstand how the common people supported or participated in the Nazi regime and the atrocities it commited. *" The fear that it will normalize the image of the Nazi regime by concentrating on the mundane everyday aspects of life that continued relatively undisturbed."* (Iggers p. 114-115). **Do you feel that Microhistory loses out on the larger context by focusing on such a narrow level, or do you feel that without understanding the individual common perspective we lose our undertsnding of how this larger contexts are able to occur seemingly under people's noses?**
