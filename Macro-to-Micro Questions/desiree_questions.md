 1. Iggers states concerning **macrohistory**, "a key objection to social science conception of a world historical process characterized by modernization was, in their view, the **human cost**." (p.102) Therefore, did the previous method of macrohistory compromise the **hummanites** aspect to history? Have  the "submerged" found a voice aided by **microhistory** in the grand narrative?  

 2.  According to Kocka, "the concentration on "small" aspects of history isolate from broader contexts rendering historical knowledge impossible and leads to the **trivialization of history**." (p. 105) However, when considering all histories and their methodologies, _aren't they all trivial_? This is based on the fact that historians conduct their research according to **their preferred** research question and topic and in doing so, champion their methods accordingly. (Is your focus the "margins" or the "centers"?)
 
3. Edward Muir notes, "theories cannot be verified because **standards of verification** come from a **modern scientific discipline** that makes the past conform to the present." (p. 110) Thus, by placing a methodological approach to the way history is conducted are we **conforming** the past? Does history need to be conducted within parameters of a model for it to be verifiable?

4. Popkin mentions the idea of _controlled speculation_. "Where the **evidence is inadequate**, researchers employ '**comparative material** from other cultural or historical situations to **infer crucial information** that may be missing or obscured in the historical record of a particular situation'." (Houses, p.179) Thus, deducing that historians may be **reluctant to embrace** this method though it has yielded success. Therefore, is historical research bound to quantitative analysis and will history/anthropology ever achieve total **"emic"** understanding?

5. According to Emile Durkheim, "the study of the **social group or community** took **precedence** over the **individual**." Furthermore he infers, "social cohesion of any society is **achieved through** communal rituals and ceremonies, and these therefore **fulfil important functions** in that **society**." (Houses, p.173) Thus, as globalization continues to accelerate will the **functionalist** approach **cease in the visibility** of "rituals" as being a **intrical part of society** as things become more homogenized?
