## Microhistory Questions
Jerome T. Mondragon

1. It's mentioned in _Macro-to Micro History_ that "the researcher's point of view becomes an intrinsic part of the account."(Iggers 110) There have been may instances where historians wrote from their point of view. When Julius Caesar wrote about his conquest of Gaul, he wrote in promoting manner by portraying himself as a glorious leader.  ("Roman Foundations, p. 53) Machiavelli also wrote from his perspective when making recommendations to the ruler. (Â _Prince_ p.4) It's important to set up the appropriate context for the historical piece, but it's also important not to taint the piece with personal opinions.  How much of the historian's view should be placed within their research without sounding self-promoting? How can a historian strike a balance between the source material and its interpretation? Is there specific criteria or guidelines?

2. It's stated that anthropologists shifts the attention of historian from political and public sphere into the towards the private, human life (Green and Troup 174). If that's the case, what is the difference between microhistory, anthropology, and biography?
 
3. In the case of Native Americans and other ethnic groups where written history is scarce, historians have gathered and compiled "comparitive material from other cultural or historic situations." (Green and Troup 179) Since Microhistory focuses on the specifics of societies, doesn't it defeat the purpose than of studying that society when drawing from different ethnic sources? 

4. History already delves into great detail about historical topics. How specific does the historical topic has to be, to be considered microhistory?

5. In the _Yucate Maya Women_, Inga Clendinnen draws upon Spanish sources to understand the Mayan women. Since the sources are exclusively male, how much of an accurate portrayal can we get of the society we're trying to interpret? (Clendinnen 184-83)
