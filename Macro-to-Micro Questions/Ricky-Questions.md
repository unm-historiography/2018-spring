## Micro/Macro Histories
### Iggers and *Houses* Questions

- The anthropologist view of functionalism led to the ideal that society should be studied as a whole. This is similar to the Annales view of total history, yet differs in methodology, as anthropologists would not care to separate different topics, such as how history would distinguish political history from economic history (*Houses*, p. 174). Why did they **specifically choose to not categorize source material?**

- If social status is what was holding microhistory back, as the lives of average individuals had no bearing in traditional historical work, **why did microhistory only gain prominence in the 1960’s**, decades after the idea of every life having prominence was accepted in the historical world (*Houses*, p. 174, Iggers, p. 102)?

- Why didn’t anthropology and historians work together before the 1940’s and the advent of ethnohistory (*Houses*, p. 175)? Their fields of work **both heavily dive into human rationality**, yet the idea of combining the fields did not flourish in the way that the hard-social sciences converged with history in the 19th century with Ranke. 

- What are some ways that anthropology has strengthened or weakened common historiographical methodologies of the late 20th century (*Houses*, p. 178-179)? **Where would you categorize ethnohistory with other new fields of history** we learned in the readings of the *Great Confusion*?

- Iggers believes that microhistory as Hans Medick approaches it is impossible without a macrosocial context (Iggers p. 105). Do you agree with Iggers, or **can microhistory provide context to the larger social standards** on its own? 

- Does history **require** the study of individuals (Iggers, p. 107)? *Microstoria* contains the belief that history should concern itself less with generalizations and social science *theories* and hone in on concrete experiences of human beings (Iggers, p. 114). Yet history thrived for decades in an environment where this concrete proof was almost unnecessary, which emphasizes the question, **is it necessary**?
