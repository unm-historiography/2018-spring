1. Iggers states that "history must turn to the conditions of everyday life as they are experienced by common people" (Iggers, p. 102). Ranke studied the elites in the past with a "*scientific history*" while remaining nationalistically motivated (Gil, p.388). 
Moving from the dusty shelves of the elites to the daily struggle of the **average Joe** was a huge step in making history accessible to *almost* everyone. Was the microhistory movement ultimately *more* scientifically motivated than the "scientific history" movement?

2. Functionalism states that "all aspects of society [are] interrelated and therefore society should be studied as a whole" (Green & Troup, p.174). Political, social, economic histories are studied separately, whereas anthropologists look at the whole picture. Does it look past the "traditional" sources lead to a *more complete history*, or does it fail to get specific enough? 

3. Geertz believes "the goal [of anthropology] is to get beneath surface behavior to reach an emic ('insiders') understanding, ...subject to their experience" (Green & Troup, p. 177). How can "scratching beneath the surface" be useful in our reconstruction of history and further our understanding of the past? How does microhistory *potentially* limit that understanding? 

4. Microhistory's advantages are within the methodology. There is a way to measure the truth it is looking for; however, it can be *too* close of a look and limit the existing outside factors (like economic factors, social institutions) that shape and reinforce our histories. This is a problem in creating a general narrative. How can this be rectified within microhistory? Does history *have* to include these outside factors to be considered a "**true history**"?
