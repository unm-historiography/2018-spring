George Iggers, “From Macro- to Microhistory: The History of Everyday Life,” p. 101-117

*Houses*, “Anthropology and ethnohistorians,” p. 172-203

1. Iggers states that many Italian and British **microhistorians began their careers following the Marxist model of history**. They would later “[challenge] the basic macrohistorical conceptions of Marxism” (Iggers, p. 102). British historian Raphael Samuel stated that **“Marxist historiography was chronologically preceded by, and has always had to co-exist with, a more broadly based and less theoretically demanding ‘people’s history’”** (*Houses*, p. 33). Could Samuel have been referring to the works of former Marxist historians turned microhistorians? Did these “professed Marxists” (Iggers, p. 102) shift away from the Marxist historical model because of its broad focus on specific social classes (the proletariat and the bourgeois) as a whole instead of on specific individuals?

2. Iggers believes that **“There is no reason why a history dealing with broad social transformations and one centering on individual existences cannot coexist and supplement each other”** (Iggers, p. 104). Should microhistorians supplement their work using macrohistorical methods? If yes, **what models would prove most useful for creating a narrative of the individual**: historical sociology, Marxist history, the Rankean model, the Annales school methods, ethnohistory, quantitative history, or some combination of all of them?

3. The **methods of microhistory have been criticized** for **“[reducing] history to anecdotal antiquarianism,” “[romanticizing] past cultures,” and taking a more speculative approach to historical narratives** (Iggers, p. 113). **This contrasted greatly with the Rankean model**, which strived to “show what actually happened” (Popkin, p. 76) by applying the “scientific method” to history (Gil, p. 383). “Practitioners of microhistory” defend their methods by arguing that **“social science approaches to history … deprived the past of its qualitative aspects and left it without a human face”** (Iggers, p. 116). Are the arguments for and against microhistorical methods both valid, or does one argument hold more weight than another? Is is more important for history to have a precise narrative or a “human face”?

4. Ethnohistory combines the fields of **anthropology, archaeology, ethnology, history, and linguistics, and utilizes a variety of sources**: from oral traditions to artifacts to written sources (*Houses*, p. 175). Would you say that the development of ethnohistory in the 1950s served as a predecessor to the dramatic “paradigm shift” that history experienced in the second half of the twentieth century (Popkin, p. 134-135)?

5. American ethnohistory faces an **“enduring problem of perspective”** when it comes to the Native American narrative (*Houses*, p. 176-177). Setting aside the problems that come with the lack of “first-hand accounts” from the indigenous peoples of North America, **would there still be a disparity** between how “insiders” and “outsiders” choose to depict Native American history (*Houses*, p. 176-177)?
