# Macro- to Micro-

- What is the purpose of studying macro-/microhistories separately? Are there merits to each as Iggers suggests, or is one inherently more accurate or useful?
- Is the "point of view" of history more important than the content? Or could it be argued that content is dictated by the point of view of the narrative of each and every work? (Iggers, p. 102)
- When Iggers says "...the individual can only be understood as part of the cultural whole," a comment supported by *Houses* definition of functionalism, is this a suggestion towards the combination of the two studies? (Iggers, p. 105/Green and Troup, p. 174)
- As historians, our purpose is to at least attempt to tell the most accurate portrayal of history possible. Does the discussion/argument on the finer points of macro- versus micro- detract from that main purpose?
