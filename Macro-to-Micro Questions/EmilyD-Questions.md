# Macro- to Micro-

- What is the purpose of studying macro-/microhistories separately? Are there merits to each as Iggers suggests, or is the **combination of the two methods** the *most* accurate study of history?
- Is the "**point of view**" of history more important than the **content**? Or could it be argued that content is dictated by the point of view of the narrative of each and every work? (Iggers, p. 102)
- When Iggers says "...the individual can only be understood as part of the cultural whole," a comment which is supported by *Houses'* definition of functionalism, is this a suggestion towards the **combination of the two studies** of microhistory and macrohistory (Iggers, p. 105/Green and Troup, p. 174)?
- How would Iggers form an argument for a **sociological study** of *demographics* within a paper on the history of England's royalty? Can you support your answer with the exerpt from page 105? 
- Would **quantitative history**--as *Houses* suggests it was intended--be assisted more by the **detail oriented** skills of microhistory's research? Or does the quantitative study of history require the **pattern finding** skills found in the study of macrohistory? ***Or*** should the theories of micro-/macrohistory be kept entirely separate from quatitative historical research? (Green and Troup, p. 143)
- **Scientific history** is best defined by Popkin as the advancement of historical research to include more **methodical ways of procuring information**, and the objective presentation of said information (Popkin, p. 97-102). Do micro- OR macro- histories **conflict** with the fundamentals of Scientific history? If either one does conflict, what does that say about the study of history in general?
- Since the inception of the **Annales School**, the role of historians has become more direct (Green and Troup, p. 87). Now, our purpose is to at least attempt to **tell the most accurate portrayal of history, with the information provided**. Does the discussion, or argument, on the finer points of macro- versus micro- *detract* from that main purpose?
