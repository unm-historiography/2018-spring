### From Macro to Micro History & Anthropology of Ethnohistorians

-	**Harmony can, in theory, exist between “broad social transformations” and those of “individual existence”** (Iggers p. 104). However, when evaluating microhistory versus macrohistory, is there more value to be found in one over the other? Does one contribute to our understanding of history more?

-	Marxist history has fluctuated in popularity over the last century (Iggers p. 102). Though taking on a historical analysis of the social classes and the common people was meant to bring the disenfranchised to the forefront of history, what can be said of the author’s claim that **Marxists and other social historians, like _Annalist_ Braudel, still did not achieve a historical narrative that assigned individuals “a human face”** (Iggers p. 107)?

-	Is it true that “**the individual can only be understood as part of a larger cultural whole**” (Iggers p. 105)? And, if the two are so inseparable, why bother separating and studying micro and macro history as different entities? Does focusing on the individual make politicized history more or less likely (Popkin pp. 97-98).

-	**Anthropological historians favor microhistory, focusing on “small communities, single events or even on individual under minute scrutiny”** (Green/Troup p. 174). Do you agree with the authors’ observation? Does this statement become truer depending on the school of anthropology being studied (Green/Troup pp. 172-173).

-	How do ethnohistorians compare to social and Marxist historians, particularly in the context of distinguishing indigenous peoples and “hearing their voices” in modernizing societies and in the historical record (Green/Troup pp. 176-177)? What might be a common or conflicting agenda behind social and ethnohistorians’ presentation of indigenous peoples?
