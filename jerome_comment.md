### Chapter 2- Greek Writing Comment
Jerome T. Mondragon

Many Greek historians including Herodotus have been criticized by modern historians by incorporating mythology into their historical works. The Greek writer Lucian of Samosata argues that in order to create good history, the historain has to be "incorruptable...impartial... and independant" rather than "being swept down by poetry's wild enthusiasm." (Popkin 34) However, it's impossible to seperate religion from history. Religion is an important to teach the origins, morals, and values of a civilization. 

Religion taught the origins of a civilization which was already being used by the Egyptians, the Persians, and Hebrews. (Popkin 26-27) Titua Livus explained the origins of Rome by writing stories of their founder Romulus. (57-58) 

The most important reason why religion was incorporated in history was because written history useful to the literate higher classes. ( Popkin 35) History had to be relatable and understood by the people. It was more sifasf because much of histories were lost or unknown (57) Therefore, it was necessary to include religion and the gods to explain these mysteries. They were necessary to teach the morals and values of the state. 

still used today.
