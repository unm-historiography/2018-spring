## Postmodernism as a Paradigm Shift

I think that **postmodernist history** (and **gender history** in particular) **is a paradigm shift**, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t **also a continuation of historiographical change** as well. The **_cynicism_** common in the different types of postmodernist historiography differs from the types of historiography we studied for spring break significantly enough that I think we can call this a “postmodernist paradigm:” **we acknowledged before that bias is ever-present, but postmodernism really hammers home that it is impossible to write an unbiased history**. However, there’s a bit of **_depressed optimism_** to it as well now: **postmodernism acknowledges the impossibility of avoiding bias, but still strives to make histories as minimally biased as possible**. With postmodernism, we can address issues like we did _in class on Monday_, when we **discussed whether or not European historians can present histories of colonized places because of their lenses of influence**, and **whether it’s possible to remove colonial bias in “postcolonial” history**.

We also get **new**(**er**) things in postmodernist history, like the **_outright_ acknowledgement that history is a tool of power in oppression**. The same way **colonialism has erased much of the history of colonized peoples** and **shifted it towards a more Euro-centric focus**, the way **women have been erased from history makes it appear like it’s “natural and inevitable” for them to be oppressed**. _(p. 253)_ Before, we see that history is a tool of power, but we don’t always see it being utilized. _In the shift to micro-history, we see a demand for more relevant histories geared towards groups_ (as well as the ability to focus more directly on individuals and small historical groups or eras), we get a little of this, but **with postmodernism, it’s more obviously geared towards encouraging social change**— like the attempt to reeducate people about **pre-colonization history**, and the **real past roles of women** in life and society.
