##### POSTMODERNISM SO FAR
Desiree' Martinez

- The readings we have discussed have not changed the way I view history but have enlightened me to the **transitions** that have occured in historical methodology. As Foucault implies, "The appearance of long periods in the history of today is _not a return_ to the philosophers of history, to the _great ages_ of the world, or to the _periodization_ dictated by the rise and fall of civilizations; it is the effect of the methodologically **concerted development** of series." (Foucault Arch p. 8) Thus, I believe that the "rupture" materialized with Marx and gave rise and **awareness** to the "working class" and to the "other." However, it is important to note that the **grand narrative** of Marx is not the same as a Postmodern narrative, but it nonetheless, paved the way to consider and revisit the **meta-narrative**. It is not hard to see from this position of the "house" that with every **major historical event** (which have effected all classes) like revolutions (Marx), the World Wars (Annales/Microhistory), and Civil Rights movements (Quantitative/Colonial/Gendered histories), have constructed ideals/viewpoints/considerations which have **initiated paradigm shifts**. And therefore, it could be hypothesized that these shifts will occur once again though we do not know what exactly that will entail. 

- I do support Postmodernisms approach to skepticism because I do believe that it has occured for too long that, "History has altered its position in relation to the document." (Foucault Arch p.6) Furthermore as Roger Chartier states, "in different times and places, a specific social reality was **constructed**, how people **conceived** of it and how they **interpreted** it to others; **created** 'imaginative works built out of _social materials_' " (Houses, p.303) Thus, we should question previous methodological approaches and learn and build from them. However, I **do not** support that there is no point to history nor that there is no truth. I feel like history is like a marriage. There is one spouses truth, the other spouses truth, and then what actually happen. We will never truly know what actually happen but nonetheless there are valid lessons to be learned and shared. Postmodernism can add value to **agency and individualism** and allows for the historian to "examine all vantage points" and contribute their brick to the "house." (Houses, p.298) 

8: wanted to see a more explicit argument about the extent to which postmodernism can be seen as similar "transition" as other shifts or if something sets it apart--you seem to have both threads here, so it's hard to discern your position.
