Postmodernism to me falls more in line with my argument on Marxism, an evolutionary conception rather than revolutionary. As many new schools of thoughts and theoretical models before it, it is effective at identifying flaws and listing critiques while only offering vague guidance towards solutions (if any). The agreeable tenants on which postmodernism is based, such as emphasizing research of historically marginalized groups or perspectives, are valid and valuable to the field.
